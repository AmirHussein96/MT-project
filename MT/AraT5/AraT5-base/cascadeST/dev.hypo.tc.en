i mean they agreed on a good salad and you &apos;re still going to add them you see

so she told me
you &apos;re right yes that &apos;s what you told me i &apos;ll try you for a month two months i &apos;ll try you from three months but something else
it &apos;s a contract the one who &apos;s going to give me one hundred fifty dinars she thought it &apos;s three hundred and fifty dinars now it &apos;s not two hundred dinars
