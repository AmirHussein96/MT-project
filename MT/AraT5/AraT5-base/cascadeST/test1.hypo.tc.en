even a little bit doesn &apos;t fall
it &apos;s like you &apos;re hitting the bag and it doesn &apos;t go down even a little bit because there &apos;s a lot of those that they sell and i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re selling and i don &apos;t know what it &apos;ll drop it i mean
i liked it it &apos;s naturally bothered her
and that &apos;s it and then patience she brought some of them
when i asked her and everything she told me it &apos;s very expensive it &apos;s about sixty dinars
they had an appointment they finished the same internship on the same internship
it &apos;s not like the other one it &apos;s colored

it &apos;s not in it &apos;s not in one session you see
because she &apos;s one and third the other girl bought it for me she thought it
it &apos;s my number and there &apos;s imen she already has another calculation i think that we &apos;re going to spend a month no i think it &apos;s too much because
