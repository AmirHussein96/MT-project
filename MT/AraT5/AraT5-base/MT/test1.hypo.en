do you understand what
yes this weekend because eid can come on sunday that's why
yes it doesn't start all of it
do you want him to come on sunday or on monday for the eid
because there's
it's not the same but i'm afraid
because this year
i i worked last year
do you understand
ah this year normally i don't work in the little eid
but there's a problem you know that one that ah
anis has her son her son as we say a baby and the first year i mean she'll spend the eid with him do you understand
so she wants to start with her son on eid day you see
and i honestly what do i have on eid day i don't have anything i can work on eid day and in the end of the days i don't work
yes i don't want to get the water downstairs
i mean ah don't you tell me you can't tell me please don't tell me you work
i told you don't you tell me to work on eid day

i feel that my brain is swollen
i feel like i'm stubborn in my head
the swimming pool of the swimming pool
the walk of the walk i don't want to say it's
i don't want to say the most important thing is that it's like a big t-shirt i'll cover my face with it

i'll make it in the sea that's it
i'm not at first i'm still fed up you see it's hot

i also didn't know that i'm going to sleep i mean it's useless i woke up late and everything so i slept
i didn't wake up i'm fine and i'm going to stay up late tonight
it's horrible it's ramadan but it's not ramadan
he's pitiful i swear that day is so bad
that's it i saw that she put pictures of the group
don't you wear them
you won't wear them i told you you won't wear them
ah i got you yes
you'll find you when i bought them it's not like you see them now when i bought them you feel like they're great they're beautiful i think they're beautiful
now you've gotten rid of them
yes i got you yes
that's it so you want to sell them i got you yes
i bought one well it's not a cake when you look at him
i bought that one at that time do you hear about it it's a gift
there's in tunisia mall
they have
no i bought them in the sales i swear the sales in
in february or in may like that do you understand
i bought it for forty-five dinars do you understand
i'll send you his pictures later when you see him he's a model a model but i put it on the side
he doesn't come from me
look did you see the top that one that he takes his hand from
when you look for a big hand a big bag it's big you see that hand you put it from the side to take a bag i put it on my shoulder
and it has two big sweaters do you understand it's white it's all black but it looks like a sweater i put it on the side exactly a sweater
but he'll take it on the side because there's like him he'll take it on my shoulders from me but i don't think he's a professional you see
he's his brother i mean but he's taking
i didn't think it's a business but it's the picture now it's a shirt i bought a shirt that's the same for the sales if it's twenty-five or twenty-five dinars
i didn't know about her asma looked at her
i bought it for twenty-five dinars it's only
one dinar i bought it for two hundred dinars i only bought it for twenty-five-five dinars i bought it for sixty-five i think i bought it for zarzis there's some sweater on the bottom
and a little not too much and you know those old shoes for kids before a little bit of sweater those sweater sandals
that's it but from the front% pw i'm stunning you see
from the back it's normal it's white it's normal
it's white it's white and there's some sweater not sweater like a sweater
i think it's fine it's not bad it's two hundred and all
the black sneakers the black sneakers i naturally don't have red sneakers that i have in front you see
i mean i have that thing that i want to change so it didn't fit me to buy black sandals
i don't know what in eighty you'll find it
so i bought i found this one at the same time black sandals and he's giving a little bit of cake that's it
i mean if i'm going to buy more
me too yes
i also started because i go out during ramadan every night my problem is that there's nothing beautiful on the top do you understand there's nothing beautiful on the top
shoes and all it's not a problem now
so much yes the shirts you feel like they're like roses
i bought i bought five dinars five dinars you buy them and take them to the mechanic to take them to the mechanic to fix them
what's wrong i said what's wrong with you
i'm not like that i have a dress that i'm going to do like that
yes the small one is three dinars and the older one is five dinars
do you understand and you take it to the mechanic to take it with the iron to cut it
that's good do you wear them or did you take them to the mechanic with iron
but even when you take them you take them to the mechanic he takes them with a hot iron to hang them
yes i didn't know about them i thought
it's better yes i also thought it's swollen i didn't know about it
rim told me that
and i have a shirt i still haven't brought it to him
i mean i've already bought those three lemonade one lemonade and the other i don't know what
the other one he'll stick them to me i didn't buy them i haven't seen them how they became that's it
that's it listen do you want
because i bought six for one and then i got angry with it from sabri
i mean i'll ask you if you want it for pants
it's expensive you know
he's stuck in the sales or forty-five
do you know them or not look look i'll tell you what's his story why i wanted to buy it
asma used to have one with pink last year it's amazing
i don't know what i took it once from her i took it she went to the summer i've been taking it in the café for a whole month
even a little bit doesn't fall
you'd be joking in the bag and he doesn't get up even a little bit because there are a lot of those that they sell and i don't know what he made you angry i mean
i liked it it's naturally expensive for her
that's it so i had to get some of them
when i asked her and everything she told me that they're bought for sixty dinars they were expensive for sixty dinars
they've brought the t-shirts and he's finished with the color% pw% pw a sweater and% pw
it's not like the other one with rice it's better
she asked me i told her check if you find a stove she didn't tell me so i got three
one for mom mounira layla and one for the other girl the other girl feels like she's taking care of us do you understand
and i can't make it to saïda i'll see of course if you want otherwise
i'll see about myself no plus i put it in the water thing
i put it in that thing imen i'm also going to pay twice
we'll always say it's twenty-five this month and the twenty-fourth next month because i'll put it in imen's car
it's not that it's not that it's the same i mean you see
because she's one and she's the other girl she thought it
it's my plan and imen has another calculation she already has another calculation if i'm going to pay for a month no i'll be too much because
you're used to it but it's great it doesn't bother me at all
so when i'm going to spend two hundred or twenty dinars a month like that and a month like that
that's it no i just told you that's it
yes yes it's difficult like that
i don't% pw i don't take it i naturally don't find it in that thing and i said it's at the same time i mean
i'll put my thing otherwise i won't take it
i'm looking for something beautiful i'll wear it it's better
yes also it's been a long time since you go there
you'll find them ready you'll send their pictures
that's it it's because of the stomach
i told you earlier we don't get tired of the stomach and i'm really talking
me too i don't anymore but you always eat me something do you understand
that's it what's left for god's sake
and i want to buy something new on the top and i want to buy something in the water you know that one feels like he's wearing nothing
listen ah what did you say
that's it sunday
fatigue
as usual it's monday
it's hard yes
it's the first time we bought the things i made that slices of clothes on top of the stairs
so he's calm on him
so we took them i told them please let me see what i have to do
i found i mean i have big bags and everything and those
they're not normal and they're not
i felt that it's too much you see
they're new i bought a machine
but i felt like we say it's too much and they're not like those things things i don't know they're normal
i thought i'd find a seller in them
i liked them with the guarantee i mean they're pretty they're pretty but when i go in to check the bag
yes when the stove is in now and i'll see the stove and everything i feel like i'm old i'm old
yes i want to buy that cake do you know it
