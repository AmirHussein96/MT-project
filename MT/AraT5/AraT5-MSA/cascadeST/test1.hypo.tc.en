yes a small hotel is three dinars the big one is five dinars
do you understand and you take him to the pharmacy and he &apos;ll sit on him and he &apos;ll hang up

i gave her a sweater of course i bought those three and jalal one and jalel and the other and i don &apos;t know what
the other one i told her no you wake up on your hands i didn &apos;t buy it i didn &apos;t see them how they become
that &apos;s it listen do you want
because i &apos;ve asked for one and you &apos;ve made a hard time for me from sfax
i mean i &apos;ll ask you if you &apos;re looking for an internship
ah it &apos;s expensive actually
did the sales end or an internship
did you know them or not i &apos;m in egypt &apos;s area what &apos;s the story it &apos;s cut off why did i want to get it
listen last year she had a pink pink one with rice it was amazing
i don &apos;t know how she came once from her i took it and she went to sweat i stayed for a whole month but the coffee shop was light
even a bottle doesn &apos;t fall
the one that &apos;s swept in the bag and doesn &apos;t bring down the handbag because there &apos;s a lot that they sell and i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re selling and i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re sweaty sweaty i mean
i liked it it &apos;s naturally bothering her
and that &apos;s it and there &apos;s patience she brought some of them
when i asked her and everything she told me that it &apos;s about sixty dinars they &apos;re expensive they &apos;re about sixty dinars
they removed the contract they finished the same training training for him
it &apos;s not like the other one it &apos;s not like the other one
so i told her see if you find dishes she told me there &apos;s not so i gave three
one that i &apos;m one for amine one for another girl the other girl even took us out you see
and i can &apos;t help sabri i &apos;m naturally going to look for a sell for him if you like it where otherwise
i &apos;ll see you &apos;ll burn myself naturally we &apos;ll cut you yes no plus i &apos;ll cut it in the water thing
i &apos;m worried about imen &apos;s stuff i &apos;m also going to pay twice
let &apos;s say it &apos;s the next month it &apos;s the next month because they &apos;re going to fix imen &apos;s boxing
it &apos;s not in it &apos;s not in one session you see
because it &apos;s one and the third one the other girl bought me she counted it
it &apos;s my count and there &apos;s imen already has another count when it &apos;s a month we &apos;ll pass in a month no i think it &apos;s too much
i used it but it &apos;s great he doesn &apos;t wake up at all
