i mean i &apos;ll ask you if you want it for trousers
it &apos;s expensive actually
he fell down in the sales or the five-thirty
do you know them or not look look i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s his story why i wanted to buy it
asma had a sweet one last year with rice it &apos;s amazing
i don &apos;t know how i took it once from her i took it she went for summer i spent a whole month taking it in the coffee shop
even a bottle doesn &apos;t fall
you &apos;d be sweat in the bag and don &apos;t go down a bit because there &apos;s a lot of those that they sell and i don &apos;t know what they &apos;d make you angry i mean
i liked her she &apos;s naturally slaughtered
and that &apos;s it so i had to bring some of them
when i asked her and everything she told me they &apos;ve removed the twenty-fifth they were expensive for sixty
they &apos;ve brought them to the thrift shop and it &apos;s full of color it &apos;s % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw % pw and it &apo
it &apos;s not like the other one it &apos;s cooked with rice it &apos;s better
she asked me i told her &apos; look and find me a job &apos; she didn &apos;t tell me &apos; so i got three&apos;
one for mom layla &apos;s layla &apos;s and one for the other girl the other girl feels like she took us out do you understand
and i can &apos;t help sabri i &apos;ll see of course if you want otherwise
i &apos;ll see for myself no plus i put it in the water thing
i &apos;m planning on that thing imen i &apos;m going to pay twice
i &apos;m going to say it &apos;s twenty-five this month and the next month because i &apos;m going to put it in imen &apos;s spoiling
it &apos;s not that it &apos;s not that it &apos;s the only one i mean you see
because she &apos;s one and she &apos;s the other girl she &apos;s counting her
it &apos;s my count and there &apos;s imen already has another count if i &apos;m going to pay for a month no i &apos;ll be a lot because
i &apos;m used to him but it &apos;s great don &apos;t worry at all
