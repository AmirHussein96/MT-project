do you have iftar and then have coffee as usual
directly and then i need it to get a little en@@ ergy i need coffee in my life i swear

that &apos;s it so do you work every day except in ramadan so that you have a little bit of rest
are you going somewhere
i mean listen maj@@ di you % pw it came % pw
i mean there are many inter@@ e@@ st@@ ing things
yes mahdia and % pw
yes it &apos;@@ s@@ -
yes that &apos;s better because you know if you do that after august fifteen the sea@@ -
the sea will become r@@ ou@@ g@@ h and the je@@ ll@@ y@@ fish will come out
july is the best time
you know even the month of june is still good although the sea is still a little bit r@@ ou@@ g@@ h
the best thing is that
two weeks
they serve iftar in ramadan and they give
everyone a place to cra@@ sh i mean
i swear they have many things i will send you the l@@ in@@ ks
i will send you the list of all the ho@@ te@@ ls
that are really good for fifty dinars you get to have iftar and suhur
they have all ca@@ te@@ go@@ ries
i will send you the l@@ in@@ ks on % pw
yes well i am thinking of taking my ni@@ e@@ ces this weekend
% pw i will go % pw
yes that &apos;s a good idea especially your son is al@@ rea@@ d@@ y@@ -
i mean you &apos;re a couple and your kid &apos;s stay is for free do you understand
yes it &apos;s for free because they have this offer for children less % p@@ w@@ -
th@@ an@@ - % pw
less than % pw three years old there is also for kids less than thirteen years old
i mean they have great stuff i mean i will send you the l@@ in@@ ks
i mean look a weekend
that is saturday and sunday will only cost you a hundred dinars
around a hundred dinars
go have some fun yeah
so i mean it will be good if you
get a change get a change of scen@@ ery
yes even % pw
what about your son is he getting a little bit better or little by little
nothing as usual it &apos;s a real problem
yes maybe at the beach and all maybe he will get hungry
yes
maybe it &apos;s his te@@ e@@ th and you don &apos;t know about it he doesn &apos;t want to
yes he doesn &apos;t want to
he &apos;s re@@ st@@ less because of his te@@ e@@ th gro@@ wing in and everything
does he still drink milk i mean the bottle
oh my god even the bottle
does he eat yogurt
at least he does did he stop drinking milk
he doesn &apos;t take the bottle at all he needs to he is still very young
no maj@@ di my friend &apos;s son
he &apos;s fourteen or thirteen years old
she told me she still gives him the bottle in the morning
oh dear i swear she made me hate children
you know she &apos;s unbelievable li@@ st@@ en@@ -
yes let me tell you he &apos;s an only child and everything
i swear she goes back home for him at l@@ un@@ ch@@ time i mean you can rely on yourself when you &apos;re fourteen years old
it &apos;s because he can &apos;t eat the sauce by himself do you see
she needs to cut the bread into little pieces for him imagine wa@@ j@@ di she takes him to the bathroom to give him a bath
and she turns on % pw the hea@@ ter
and clos@@ es the win@@ do@@ ws
then she ba@@ the@@ s him and dri@@ es his hair in there do you see
i swear when she pic@@ ks him up from kindergarten and school
she brings a pair of under@@ wear
and a t-@@ shirt with her
and she changes his clothes before she takes him out because she is afraid that he is swea@@ ty and will catch a cold
anyway
she thinks that &apos;s normal and that &apos;s how children should be ra@@ ised
hello yes
do you see
you should let the kid rely on himself
yes that &apos;s necessary
yes he should rely on himself whether he wants to eat or not it should be up to him
one should always try to provide healthy food like bsi@@ ssa a little % pw
yes the li@@ qu@@ id one the li@@ qu@@ id one wa@@ j@@ di
is it@@ -
yeah that &apos;s it he &apos;s still a little boy he will grow up bear with him that &apos;s it
% pw yeah
did you order a second one % pw
ah % pw
but i encoura@@ ge you at least it is the same mess
it &apos;s like old people say you sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ -
have a first child and continue with the rest so you finish with di@@ ap@@ ers at the same time and they go to school at the same time
and so you don &apos;t repeat everything from the beginning
did your mother go to france
no
yeah what &apos;s her name
amal
ala

hello welcome how are things where are you how are you doing how are things how &apos;s health
are you fine thank god is the family fine
what &apos;s new with you
yes how are you doing tell me how is work
i wish yes it &apos;s an amazing idea here they say it would be amazing it will be hot on friday and saturday and sunday
go go by god go
have a change of air enjoy better
where are you going where are you int@@ ending
that &apos;s it then since it rained all that rain then what else is going to happen
by great god god be with us so fine are you fine
did you see re@@ em
i wonder when she will come by
poor thing
happy
she &apos;s still yes by god she &apos;s missed honestly
we &apos;re used to seeing each other always and all god is almighty
see see
by god i don &apos;t know here i &apos;m still waiting for my husband i &apos;ll check with him when we are going to spend some days in a hotel
when he tells me i &apos;ll take it
my sister &apos;s wedding my sister &apos;s wedding it actually starts
there &apos;s no ru@@ l@@ er but god wait i &apos;ll tell you how my sister &apos;s wedding starts it &apos;s in august
in august but it starts on the twenty-@@ first of august and ends on the twenty-@@ sixth of august
what did my sister tell me my sister actually gave me an idea she told me don &apos;t take leave on the twenty-@@ first and the twenty-@@ second of august
she told me on the twenty-@@ first there &apos;s hammam she told me go to work and then come we &apos;re naturally going at three
she told me and the twenty-@@ second is the starting day of henna she told me it &apos;s already a dinner and so@@ la@@ mia at night she told me would you waste it which means go to work and when you finish working come directly here
her talk is really logical it means it &apos;s pointless so i would just pass wednesday and thursday and friday at my sister &apos;s wedding
and i would leave some at least for the return or for the kids &apos; return to school
no no no i don &apos;t spend the night there no
on saturday yes
and in the m@@ uni@@ ci@@ pa@@ lity plus also even on saturday we don &apos;t work even w@@ ti@@ a days and all it &apos;s pointless i &apos;m really my sister &apos;s wedding days i guess it &apos;s useless to take leave
but i say they might need me a bit in se@@ tting the furniture or something
exactly i won &apos;t waste that week i won &apos;t waste it on leave
yes i guess it &apos;s better that i do that
by god they said it would get hot they even in@@ for@@ med about it earlier yo@@ m@@ na said it to me she told me asma they actually said it will be getting so hot
that &apos;s it it will get super hot i by god kids want to go swim
by god if it gets hot i will take them
that &apos;s it sister what what will we do god be with us by great god
by god today i &apos;ll go have iftar at my family &apos;s house and spend the night there
mom said she would make couscous and salad
and my husband will stay with his mom
we divi@@ ded today siblings &apos; divi@@ sion
i &apos;ll take my girls with me
that &apos;s it because my mother-in-law is insi@@ sting she said with me
and my bro@@ ther@@ -in-law and my sister-in-law are with her i told her there your son with you and i will also go to my mother
why
and no uh i wasn &apos;t with mom even yesterday and the day before i wasn &apos;t with her and tomorrow i won &apos;t be with her and on sunday i won &apos;t be with her so i don &apos;t go to her today either
she would feel bad that is why does she want her children with her and i don &apos;t go to mom
i told him you stay with your mom
and i &apos;ll go have iftar at my family &apos;s house
so that he doesn &apos;t an@@ ger his mother and father as well would say i would like my son to be with me on the middle night so why would they want us all with them so i divi@@ ded
i told him you stay with your mom and i will go to mom
he &apos;s actually never said no to me it means when it &apos;s like that and i &apos;m already i since i &apos;m going to spend the night with her it means i should go in my car
you got it so it &apos;s pointless taking two cars
it &apos;s in va@@ in that &apos;s why sister
by great god it &apos;s all about ca@@ ring for others i sister i care for what my parents want i make them sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fi@@ ed with me and he too sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fi@@ es his mom and dad is it so or not
that &apos;s it that &apos;s it sister
that &apos;s it then what would we do what should be should be
are your mother and father fine when are they going to sal@@ a@@ k@@ ta
fine yes she brought him yes she couldn &apos;t find a place to leave him poor thing
poor her see she ar@@ ri@@ ves at five poor her she ar@@ ri@@ ves at five fi@@ ve@@ -thirty at home

by god he &apos;s poor he does that many times
he comes to take her home and then goes back to work

really
five minutes ago you were kidding me how s@@ ly you are
a factory what factory
oh my god
meaning i study an@@ es@@ the@@ sia and i work in a factory at the end nice thing
no it is nice i worked in a factory with han@@ in before
% pw i swear i swear i swear that i was paid more than my salary now
you know at that time we worked for thirteen days and we were paid one hundred and forty dinars
i swear that i worked for thirteen days i worked for thirteen days and % pw i worked three days more than han@@ in because i think that she felt tired at that time or
anyway i worked for thirteen days and she worked for fifteen days she was paid one hundred and ten or one hundred and twenty dinars and i was paid one hundred and forty or one hundred and fifty dinars
we were very happy on that day
but it was very tiring it was very tiring it was very tiring
the job i worked with han@@ in
in the factory and without having cha@@ irs and we stood up from seven o &apos;clock in the morning until five o &apos;clock in the evening
ah car and plane par@@ ts do you know where this is ah
do you know the coffee shop where you stayed with khawla and the other group
before that turn you continue going ahead a little it is after that squ@@ are
it &apos;s new it &apos;s new it &apos;s not it &apos;s not old
did you understand
actually concerning the money i feel like she des@@ p@@ ised me
but let me tell you why
but let me tell you why she hi@@ red two girls before
one of them da@@ ma@@ ged the car en@@ g@@ ine
and the other one was calling her every five or ten minutes and told her i feel pain in my feet the sun is very hot how will i leave the car far away and enter the neighborhood without it
how is that one do you know that one who pret@@ ends that she is deli@@ ca@@ te and in the end her husband pre@@ ven@@ ted her from working
she told me that i mean that i waste my time to teach them and i do a training for them and so on and she told me that i pay them five hundred or more than that at that time
meaning they agreed on a good salary and it was as@@ su@@ med that she will increa@@ se it
and in the end they left her alone they learned the job secre@@ ts they sp@@ read it and there are many other things
so she told me
good yes that &apos;s what she told me she told me that she will see my work for one or two months for three months ma@@ xi@@ mum when % pw but the other thing
ah the si@@ v@@ p contract that will give me one hundred and fifty dinars she knows that it is three hundred and fifty dinars not two hundred
did you understand she knows about the si@@ v@@ p contract
she knows about the si@@ v@@ p contract because in the % pw first two years of working the go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment gives me one hundred and fifty dinars as a si@@ v@@ p contract
did you understand meaning she % pw
yes i mean when she told me ah the amount that i will pay you she told me that i will pay three hundred and fifty dinars so i felt happy because i thought it was without the amount from the si@@ v@@ p
so she told me that it inclu@@ des the si@@ v@@ p amount i mean i will give you only two hundred dinars
so sho@@ r@@ tly before i was talking with my friend salma she told me nou@@ ha do not use the si@@ v@@ p contract for a job that you are not % pw i mean % pw sure that you will continue doing it
she told me that because when you start working in something related to your field in a clinic or a medi@@ cal de@@ le@@ ga@@ te or in something else
meaning
they don &apos;t like that you have already used the si@@ v@@ p contract
when they find that you have worked using it before
did you understand it should not be used until you find a good job
