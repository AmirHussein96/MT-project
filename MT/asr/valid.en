how are you doing in ramadan
do you have iftar and then have coffee as usual
directly and then i need it to get a little energy i need coffee in my life i swear

are you going somewhere
i mean listen majdi you % pw it came % pw
i mean there are many interesting things
yes mahdia and % pw
yes it &apos;s-
yes that &apos;s better because you know if you do that after august fifteen the sea-
the sea will become rough and the jellyfish will come out
july is the best time
you know even the month of june is still good although the sea is still a little bit rough
the best thing is that
two weeks
they serve iftar in ramadan and they give
everyone a place to crash i mean
i swear they have many things i will send you the links

yes that &apos;s a good idea especially your son is already-
i mean you &apos;re a couple and your kid &apos;s stay is for free do you understand
yes it &apos;s for free because they have this offer for children less % pw-
than- % pw
less than % pw three years old there is also for kids less than thirteen years old
i mean they have great stuff i mean i will send you the links
i mean look a weekend
that is saturday and sunday will only cost you a hundred dinars
around a hundred dinars
go have some fun yeah
so i mean it will be good if you
get a change get a change of scenery
yes even % pw
what about your son is he getting a little bit better or little by little
nothing as usual it &apos;s a real problem
yes maybe at the beach and all maybe he will get hungry
yes
maybe it &apos;s his teeth and you don &apos;t know about it he doesn &apos;t want to
yes he doesn &apos;t want to
he &apos;s restless because of his teeth growing in and everything
does he still drink milk i mean the bottle
oh my god even the bottle
does he eat yogurt
at least he does did he stop drinking milk
he doesn &apos;t take the bottle at all he needs to he is still very young
no majdi my friend &apos;s son
he &apos;s fourteen or thirteen years old
she told me she still gives him the bottle in the morning
oh dear i swear she made me hate children
you know she &apos;s unbelievable listen-
yes let me tell you he &apos;s an only child and everything
i swear she goes back home for him at lunchtime i mean you can rely on yourself when you &apos;re fourteen years old
it &apos;s because he can &apos;t eat the sauce by himself do you see
she needs to cut the bread into little pieces for him imagine wajdi she takes him to the bathroom to give him a bath
and she turns on % pw the heater
and closes the windows
then she bathes him and dries his hair in there do you see
i swear when she picks him up from kindergarten and school
she brings a pair of underwear
and a t-shirt with her
and she changes his clothes before she takes him out because she is afraid that he is sweaty and will catch a cold
anyway
she thinks that &apos;s normal and that &apos;s how children should be raised
hello yes
do you see
you should let the kid rely on himself
yes that &apos;s necessary
yes he should rely on himself whether he wants to eat or not it should be up to him
one should always try to provide healthy food like bsissa a little % pw
yes the liquid one the liquid one wajdi
is it-
yeah that &apos;s it he &apos;s still a little boy he will grow up bear with him that &apos;s it
% pw yeah
did you order a second one % pw
ah % pw
but i encourage you at least it is the same mess
it &apos;s like old people say you should-
have a first child and continue with the rest so you finish with diapers at the same time and they go to school at the same time
and so you don &apos;t repeat everything from the beginning
did your mother go to france
no
yeah what &apos;s her name
amal
ala
oh she gave them beautiful names she gave them beautiful names

i went to work i went in the morning
i went and whatnot as usual you know serving the people is going well
we sat down and got comfy and whatnot
we sat down and got comfy
we sat down and got comfy and whatnot the work had started and then there were
there were like departures we got in a truck we went here and there
we moved around but it didn &apos;t
some problems occurred afterwards at work there were some things that didn &apos;t go well and everything
so i so i just left i left early today
and there were some problems with the boss and everything that &apos;s it
that &apos;s it and then i went home we have that olive tree that &apos;s in the garden you &apos;re already aware of it
for real god bless it produced five sacks
for real five buckets i got someone who &apos;s going to buy he told me twenty five dinars
and then
i didn &apos;t sell dude dude i should have sold it to him and let it go that way
afterwards i came across i went to someone he told me fifteen dinars
and the other told me ten dinars
i expected more i thought it &apos;d all be cool with twenty three or twenty four dinars
that &apos;s it but it actually turns out
it &apos;s not sure i &apos;ll even get twenty two dinars
i went out earlier i went out and found that one chahine he was like i &apos;ll drop you off there he dropped me off there and left me
chahine was like i &apos;ll get you there with me he dropped me off he talked to his friend about it
his friend was like does it include my tip and everything
i don &apos;t understand what tip as if he was going to go sell a cow

&apos;is it true my dear is it true aren &apos;t they lying to me &apos; i told her &apos; no i swear&apos;
i told her &apos; i swear if there were something like that or that &apos; he would have told her &apos; hurry up do the operation&apos;
rest aunt let me tell you rest well and do the operation for her it needs to be removed no matter what
so is it by laser does it cause you pain when it &apos;s done by laser

anyway i called her earlier i don &apos;t have spices because she took them from me and they ran out
i told her &apos; aunt give me some would you like to give me some early in the morning &apos; so she told me &apos; but i &apos;m in the bathroom and you &apos;re calling me &apos; aunt &apos; &apos; instead of calling aunt i called maha

actually he told her &apos; work isn &apos;t a game&apos;
you get it reserved they send it
they have like those ones in turkey those ones
with two places i told her &apos; dear take care of them&apos;
no i told him i said that i told him &apos; for example if you want me to work night shifts tell me and i &apos;ll work for you&apos;
you know it seems to me that it seems to me that it &apos;s unlikely it would be at night
hello welcome how are things where are you how are you doing how are things how &apos;s health
are you fine thank god is the family fine
what &apos;s new with you
yes how are you doing tell me how is work
i wish yes it &apos;s an amazing idea here they say it would be amazing it will be hot on friday and saturday and sunday
go go by god go
have a change of air enjoy better
where are you going where are you intending
that &apos;s it then since it rained all that rain then what else is going to happen
by great god god be with us so fine are you fine
did you see reem
i wonder when she will come by
poor thing
happy
she &apos;s still yes by god she &apos;s missed honestly
we &apos;re used to seeing each other always and all god is almighty
see see
by god i don &apos;t know here i &apos;m still waiting for my husband i &apos;ll check with him when we are going to spend some days in a hotel
when he tells me i &apos;ll take it
my sister &apos;s wedding my sister &apos;s wedding it actually starts
there &apos;s no ruler but god wait i &apos;ll tell you how my sister &apos;s wedding starts it &apos;s in august
in august but it starts on the twenty-first of august and ends on the twenty-sixth of august
what did my sister tell me my sister actually gave me an idea she told me don &apos;t take leave on the twenty-first and the twenty-second of august
she told me on the twenty-first there &apos;s hammam she told me go to work and then come we &apos;re naturally going at three
she told me and the twenty-second is the starting day of henna she told me it &apos;s already a dinner and solamia at night she told me would you waste it which means go to work and when you finish working come directly here
her talk is really logical it means it &apos;s pointless so i would just pass wednesday and thursday and friday at my sister &apos;s wedding
and i would leave some at least for the return or for the kids &apos; return to school
no no no i don &apos;t spend the night there no
on saturday yes
and in the municipality plus also even on saturday we don &apos;t work even wtia days and all it &apos;s pointless i &apos;m really my sister &apos;s wedding days i guess it &apos;s useless to take leave
but i say they might need me a bit in setting the furniture or something
exactly i won &apos;t waste that week i won &apos;t waste it on leave
yes i guess it &apos;s better that i do that
by god they said it would get hot they even informed about it earlier yomna said it to me she told me asma they actually said it will be getting so hot
that &apos;s it it will get super hot i by god kids want to go swim
by god if it gets hot i will take them
that &apos;s it sister what what will we do god be with us by great god
by god today i &apos;ll go have iftar at my family &apos;s house and spend the night there
mom said she would make couscous and salad
and my husband will stay with his mom
we divided today siblings &apos; division
i &apos;ll take my girls with me
that &apos;s it because my mother-in-law is insisting she said with me
and my brother-in-law and my sister-in-law are with her i told her there your son with you and i will also go to my mother
why
and no uh i wasn &apos;t with mom even yesterday and the day before i wasn &apos;t with her and tomorrow i won &apos;t be with her and on sunday i won &apos;t be with her so i don &apos;t go to her today either
she would feel bad that is why does she want her children with her and i don &apos;t go to mom
i told him you stay with your mom
and i &apos;ll go have iftar at my family &apos;s house
so that he doesn &apos;t anger his mother and father as well would say i would like my son to be with me on the middle night so why would they want us all with them so i divided
i told him you stay with your mom and i will go to mom
he &apos;s actually never said no to me it means when it &apos;s like that and i &apos;m already i since i &apos;m going to spend the night with her it means i should go in my car
you got it so it &apos;s pointless taking two cars
it &apos;s in vain that &apos;s why sister
by great god it &apos;s all about caring for others i sister i care for what my parents want i make them satisfied with me and he too satisfies his mom and dad is it so or not
that &apos;s it that &apos;s it sister
that &apos;s it then what would we do what should be should be
are your mother and father fine when are they going to salakta
fine yes she brought him yes she couldn &apos;t find a place to leave him poor thing
poor her see she arrives at five poor her she arrives at five five-thirty at home
directly to the kitchen because she &apos;s waiting for her husband
awake every day a taxi every day a taxi she &apos;s not near she lives in manouba actually
she should buy a car i told her myself
by god i always encourage her senda
god willing god willing
by god the car is a blessing senda you know
by god by god the biggest blessing in the world
honestly anyone without a car will be stuck especially women
by god imagine you go home at five you neither find time to take a nap nor to rest or anything poor her directly to the kitchen
by god it &apos;s too much for her honestly by god i feel bad for her sister god is almighty what will she do
that &apos;s it he works in the private sector for el mzabi
so no mercy no mercy
he does that sometimes you know
by god he &apos;s poor he does that many times
he comes to take her home and then goes back to work
he did that i don &apos;t know for many times during ramadan but when there was no fasting he did that many times
see god is almighty god is almighty
may god ease it for her and she buys a car and rests
what yes yes she was encouraged and all and then
she counted she counted it and figured out she &apos;d be pushed into a corner
what did reem do by god
she &apos;s waiting god willing god be with her
god willing god be with her
by great god
yes i guess at that time
i guess yes god willing may god ease it for her

we were very happy on that day
but it was very tiring it was very tiring it was very tiring
the job i worked with hanin
in the factory and without having chairs and we stood up from seven o &apos;clock in the morning until five o &apos;clock in the evening
ah car and plane parts do you know where this is ah
do you know the coffee shop where you stayed with khawla and the other group
before that turn you continue going ahead a little it is after that square
it &apos;s new it &apos;s new it &apos;s not it &apos;s not old
did you understand
actually concerning the money i feel like she despised me
but let me tell you why
but let me tell you why she hired two girls before
one of them damaged the car engine
and the other one was calling her every five or ten minutes and told her i feel pain in my feet the sun is very hot how will i leave the car far away and enter the neighborhood without it
how is that one do you know that one who pretends that she is delicate and in the end her husband prevented her from working
she told me that i mean that i waste my time to teach them and i do a training for them and so on and she told me that i pay them five hundred or more than that at that time
meaning they agreed on a good salary and it was assumed that she will increase it
and in the end they left her alone they learned the job secrets they spread it and there are many other things
so she told me
good yes that &apos;s what she told me she told me that she will see my work for one or two months for three months maximum when % pw but the other thing
ah the sivp contract that will give me one hundred and fifty dinars she knows that it is three hundred and fifty dinars not two hundred
did you understand she knows about the sivp contract
she knows about the sivp contract because in the % pw first two years of working the government gives me one hundred and fifty dinars as a sivp contract
did you understand meaning she % pw
yes i mean when she told me ah the amount that i will pay you she told me that i will pay three hundred and fifty dinars so i felt happy because i thought it was without the amount from the sivp
so she told me that it includes the sivp amount i mean i will give you only two hundred dinars
so shortly before i was talking with my friend salma she told me nouha do not use the sivp contract for a job that you are not % pw i mean % pw sure that you will continue doing it
she told me that because when you start working in something related to your field in a clinic or a medical delegate or in something else
meaning
they don &apos;t like that you have already used the sivp contract
when they find that you have worked using it before
did you understand it should not be used until you find a good job
