so my boss said i could take two days off
so i took them i didn &apos;t take them in a row on purpose
i took a monday on purpose close to the weekend

that is about the weekend i could
yes exactly it &apos;s going to be too much i will remember all of my problems
i was like it &apos;s okay i will have this day in the middle
so the week wouldn &apos;t seem so long i was like okay i &apos;ll work for three days and get back
that &apos;s it
seriously ramadan is not good for working really
i would sleep at around midday one o &apos;clock
i would sleep at around midday one o &apos;clock
then wake up i don &apos;t know like cook and help in the kitchen and all
then go out and get home with the kid
the rest of the day repeat i mean i just watched them in the evening that &apos;s all
that &apos;s all
i used to spend ramadan like that that &apos;s how i spent it then then i would watch % pw
almost all of the series i would keep repea@@ ting them until the morning i repea@@ ted them
i sleep at nine
just like that yes you repeat everything
that &apos;s it that &apos;s better
please tell me how is the th@@ re@@ e@@ -@@ g treating you
does it cost much i mean does it take up so much
didn &apos;t you get the feeling that it costs a lot
everybody is compla@@ ining about it
i think it &apos;s done on purpose for ramadan
i had in the bal@@ ance ten dinars the other time
i got ten dinars and i put
i made that one@@ -@@ month offer that fle@@ x@@ y too it lasts for
but the month would go by the thirty days will be over and i hadn &apos;t even used it up yet i don &apos;t finish it all
it wasn &apos;t even one week and it ended
it would be like for two days the nine@@ -@@ h@@ und@@ re@@ d-@@ millimes offer
i tried that only once
the problem is with facebook
even if you don &apos;t open vi@@ de@@ os they would open au@@ to@@ ma@@ ti@@ cally because that thing without a sound uses up un@@ its
i try to swi@@ pe away from them but it gets it it just has to
did you remove the key or did you leave it
you know it &apos;s
ah there
ah it &apos;s un@@ li@@ mi@@ ted after eleven yes yes
to my kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge they are fra@@ u@@ ds
yes i used to watch them on my phone i would put on a movie and watch it i would repeat e@@ pi@@ so@@ des and all
and would still get me through the month now you know i just had it last week
i watched the two or three e@@ pi@@ so@@ des from the weekend because in the middle of the week i watch things at work you see
and sometimes when i don &apos;t go out i watch them here at home
and i watch them at work it &apos;s just for the weekend e@@ pi@@ so@@ des
% pw because on saturday i go out on friday and saturday
i don &apos;t go out on sunday that is i use it for two days
two e@@ pi@@ so@@ des
that weekend i had watched two e@@ pi@@ so@@ des of fla@@ sh@@ back and two e@@ pi@@ so@@ des of % pw and it was out
% pw i used to put on mo@@ vi@@ es using it
well that &apos;s it
ad@@ s@@ l is the best choice that &apos;s it but it doesn &apos;t work in our neighborhood they didn &apos;t get it yet
how much do you have left on it
i swear i forgot whether it was one or two years
it &apos;s a j@@ am
it costs a hundred and twenty dinars per year
a hundred and twenty dinars per year and you would
it won &apos;t get j@@ am@@ med or anything
for te@@ le@@ co@@ m you have to for te@@ le@@ co@@ m one needs a te@@ le@@ co@@ m line
yes that &apos;s it
you have to get a line do you have a line
do you a te@@ le@@ co@@ m line
yeah then you can get it
you see it will cost less thirty dinars how much does the other one cost each month
it &apos;s great it &apos;s great mu@@ l@@ ti@@ p@@ ly it by twelve
mu@@ l@@ ti@@ p@@ ly it by twelve
it &apos;s going to be more than two hundred and forty it &apos;s more than two hundred and forty
you see it &apos;s more than two hundred and forty it &apos;s going to be two hundred and fif@@ ty-@@ two dinars
you see two hundred and fif@@ ty-@@ two dinars
it &apos;s less it &apos;s less that is it &apos;s a ma@@ xi@@ mum of a hundred and eighty thousand that could get you great ad@@ s@@ l and wi@@ -@@ fi conne@@ ction that won &apos;t be j@@ am@@ med
you see you will save like seventy or eighty dinars
there are phones in the neighborhood
now after all
and you know that my l@@ ap@@ top was sto@@ l@@ en then then and i &apos;m not planning on buying another one
i mean there is no use
actually well i need it sometimes i &apos;ll be stuck in the room i need to watch something it &apos;s not practi@@ cal
yes and i have like this thing
you see i want something big that gets you to focus more
like usual
that &apos;s all it looks like it &apos;s going to be hot today
i didn &apos;t go out
it &apos;s obvious it &apos;s hot inside the house
start using you start using like this thing
try to use like a h@@ at that thing
i see yes
because a h@@ at would cover your face too
ah no it doesn &apos;t cover your hands
i did it last year i &apos;m getting lazy
i did it last year i had this one to use when i was walking they were okay i mean they la@@ sted until july
then i used this thing

you see i don &apos;t pay attention i didn &apos;t put on sun@@ sc@@ re@@ en from the beginning
that &apos;s it no it &apos;s over you see it &apos;s like i had one of these t@@ ans
i once tried to get a tan at the pool without using
like in va@@ in
no it worked for me it worked for me i told you i had a tan just like that
i mean i didn &apos;t swim and i got a tan
just like that you see but it was fresh then it wasn &apos;t like beach time it &apos;s not like a beach it would be ho@@ tter still
that &apos;s it
god is the only god and mohamed is his messenger
i didn &apos;t go out
he came over to your house
hello yes hi are you doing fine
how are you doing are you feeling tired
huh what did you tell me
i said are you feeling tired
i myself i swear to god did know i &apos;ll be sleeping i mean it wasn &apos;t necessary i woke up late and all so i fell asleep
i woke up not feeling well and i &apos;ll have to work very late at night
how boring and st@@ al@@ e is ramadan but ramadan isn &apos;t the real reason
it &apos;s such a dra@@ g i swear to god how boring is that day
that &apos;s it i saw that you up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed some pictures in the group
you don &apos;t wear them
you don &apos;t wear them i said you don &apos;t wear them
ah i understand yes
well you probably didn &apos;t feel the same about them when you were about to buy them you probably felt they were awesome and very lovely when you were going to buy them
you grew tired of them now
yes i understand yes
that &apos;s true so you start to feel like selling them i understand yes
i bought one myself well it doesn &apos;t look like a back@@ pack when you look at it
i bought it from pri@@ me d &apos;@@ or did you hear about it pri@@ me d &apos;@@ or
t@@ un@@ i@@ si@@ e ma@@ ll also has it
they have it
no i bought them during the sal@@ e i swear to god the sal@@ e in
in late ap@@ ri@@ l or the start of may something like that do you get it
a seventy percent i bought it for forty-five dinars do you get it
i &apos;ll show you pictures of it later when i look at it it has the sh@@ ap@@ e of a back@@ pack but i wear it on the side
it doesn &apos;t work when i wear it on my back
look you know that one that you carry from the top
the stra@@ p when you look at a big stra@@ p of a back@@ pack the bag is actually big you see that stra@@ p that you put on your back to carry it from i put that one on my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der
and it has two two big st@@ am@@ ps you know it &apos;s all black lea@@ ther but it looks like a back@@ pack i wear it to the side in the ex@@ ac@@ t sh@@ ap@@ e of a back@@ pack
but it &apos;s car@@ ried to the side because there &apos;s one like it that &apos;s car@@ ried on the back but it doesn &apos;t seem practi@@ cal you know
it &apos;s exactly the same i mean but it &apos;s car@@ ried
it doesn &apos;t seem practi@@ cal to me but it looks like it looks like a back@@ pack i bought those sneakers at the time as well during the sal@@ e they were for n@@ in@@ ty-@@ nine and went down to thirty-five
it was by chance i had no idea that asma found out about it
i got it for thirty-five while it was
for a hundred dinars i got it for thirty-five and the bag was for nine@@ ty-@@ nine and got it for for@@ ty-@@ seven i think the sneakers had some h@@ ay on the bottom
just some not much and you know those old kids &apos; sandals from back in the day those baby sandals with ho@@ les in them
just like that but they have those % pw si@@ l@@ ver sp@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ les on the front you know
and from the back it &apos;s normal white just normal
it &apos;s so@@ le is white and there are dry leaves on it not dry leaves it &apos;s like ca@@ mel h@@ ay
i sounds like a good deal to me for thirty-five and all
the bag is black the bag is black i actually don &apos;t own a black bag in the first place the one i own has gotten old you know
so i have just one that &apos;s % pw and i wanted to change it so i didn &apos;t have the opportunity to buy a black bag
i don &apos;t it &apos;ll be around eighty
so i found and got this one it both works as a black bag and a back@@ pack that &apos;s it
i mean if i &apos;d buy some more
yes it &apos;s the same for me
i &apos;m having trouble too because i go out every night during ramadan and my problem is that i can &apos;t find any to@@ p@@ -@@ wear to my li@@ king you know there isn &apos;t any fashi@@ on@@ able to@@ p@@ -@@ wear
shoes and all aren &apos;t a problem
so very much so yes it feels like shirts are very much so not they &apos;re coming up with those f@@ lor@@ al
bor@@ dea@@ u@@ x i got some for five dinars for five dinars you buy them and take them to the tail@@ or ask him to ir@@ on them and they &apos;ll get att@@ ac@@ hed
the shirt i said your shirt
it &apos;s not like that i have a dress that i &apos;m gonna do the same for
yes the small mo@@ ti@@ f costs three dinars and the big mo@@ ti@@ f costs five dinars
do you get it and you take them to the tail@@ or he &apos;d pass the ir@@ on over the top of them it &apos;ll get att@@ ac@@ hed
yes that &apos;s good and did you se@@ w them or did you take them to the tail@@ or to ir@@ on them
but even if you take them take them to the tail@@ or to stea@@ m them with his hot ir@@ on they &apos;d get att@@ ac@@ hed
yes i didn &apos;t know about them i actually thought
that &apos;s good yes i myself thought it was se@@ wn i had no idea
rim told me that
he also has my shirt i still didn &apos;t get it from him
i mean the je@@ ans i already have bought those three li@@ p@@ sti@@ cks one is a li@@ p@@ stick and i don &apos;t know what the other one is
b@@ ir@@ dy will att@@ ach the other one for me % pw i didn &apos;t get them i didn &apos;t see how they have become that &apos;s it
that &apos;s it listen do you want
because i got six and then i ran into trouble with sabri because of one of them
so i mean i &apos;m asking you if you want i@@ to@@ f the pants
it &apos;s expensive honestly
it &apos;s price went down during the sal@@ e it has gotten to forty-five
do you know them or not look look i &apos;m gonna tell the story behind them why i wanted to get them
asma last year had a bro@@ wn and pink one it &apos;s amazing
i &apos;m not sure how but i took it from her once while she went on vacation i had it for a whole month i was getting coffee in it
not a single drop was spi@@ lled
she would be fri@@ s@@ king the bag and not a single drop would spi@@ ll because there would be a lot of these things they were selling i don &apos;t know what i mean it would fall down and get spi@@ lled
i liked it but it got sto@@ l@@ en from her anyway
that &apos;s it so i had to get one of them
when i asked her and all she told me that their price had dropped to forty-five because they used to be expensive they used to sell for sixty
their price came down to forty-five and add to it that it &apos;s pi@@ st@@ ac@@ hi@@ o green and white
it &apos;s not like the other one bro@@ wn with pink is better
she asked about some for me i told her try and find me a bro@@ wn one so when she found none i or@@ dered three
one for imen one for le@@ ila and one for me the other girl it looks like the other girl had let us down you know
and i can &apos;t af@@ ford to run into trouble with sabri so i thought if you &apos;d want to of course otherwise
i &apos;ll look around myself no and i also was barely able to add it to imen &apos;s thing
i was barely able to add it to imen &apos;s thing i myself will be paying it in two tr@@ an@@ ches
let &apos;s say a tr@@ an@@ che for fif@@ ty-five for this month and a tr@@ an@@ che for fif@@ ty-five for next month because i &apos;ll add it to imen &apos;s bi@@ ll
it &apos;s not it &apos;s just one lot i mean you know
because the one that be@@ lon@@ gs to other girl is added to her bi@@ ll
mine is added to her bi@@ ll and imen also has another bi@@ ll already and if i have to pay the forty-five in just one month then no that would be too much for me because
i used it it was amazing it didn &apos;t get spi@@ lled at all
so i will sp@@ l@@ it a tr@@ an@@ che of fif@@ ty-five into two months
that &apos;s it you don &apos;t have to i just told you and that &apos;s it
yes yes it &apos;s tough in that case
i don &apos;t get in the first place and you won &apos;t find that ther@@ mo@@ s anywhere i thought it would be once and for all i mean
i &apos;ll att@@ ach mine otherwise i won &apos;t get it by itself
i pre@@ f@@ er a cute something to wear it &apos;s better
yes also i mean you &apos;d find that she had a lot when you go there
you find them ready already she should just send their pictures
that &apos;s it they don &apos;t of buying things
it &apos;s always like that i told you they don &apos;t get tired of buying stuff i &apos;m serious
i myself don &apos;t anymore but sometimes some things would temp@@ t me
that &apos;s it how much would we leave on the side anyway by your mother
and i &apos;d like to buy some new to@@ p@@ -@@ wear and i &apos;d like to buy some new foo@@ t-@@ wear like that i feel like i &apos;m na@@ ked i don &apos;t have anything

no no the problem here is that the mus@@ c@@ le is stre@@ tching
so when you exer@@ ci@@ se
your mus@@ c@@ le en@@ lar@@ ges
are you following or no
what about you are you going to register or no
yes may god be with you
tell me how you do it
no no

and if you are f@@ on@@ d of it go for it
you already have to catch on quick

a pla@@ ster ca@@ re@@ er is mon@@ e@@ y@@ -@@ sp@@ in@@ ning but the i@@ ta@@ li@@ an pa@@ in@@ ting is just like any other pa@@ in@@ ting
not a big difference
from normal pa@@ in@@ ting
i don &apos;t know i think there is and@@ al@@ us@@ i@@ an pla@@ ster or moroc@@ can moroc@@ can

there is and@@ al@@ us@@ i@@ an
there is moroc@@ can
i don &apos;t know or maybe they are the same

the problem is that one me@@ ter can even cost can even cost
one hundred fifty dinars for one me@@ ter
no see
how much are you going to gain
use your mind

if you go for pla@@ ster if you go for
it would be better for you if you go for pla@@ ster

your future is what matters
and i only have to ad@@ vise you
i don &apos;t care about your choice
i said it and you
it &apos;s up to you if you want to go for pla@@ ster go for it

he &apos;s going to put tra@@ bel@@ si and ke@@ ch@@ ri@@ a both of them together
by allah god protect us because this game is kind of strange
it doesn &apos;t bo@@ de well if we don &apos;t win this game
it would be a ca@@ tast@@ ro@@ p@@ he remember to say he said it
by the great allah by the great allah
it &apos;s a strange thing i have dou@@ b@@ ts to be honest i have dou@@ b@@ ts that they win this game
because el-@@ tar@@ a@@ j@@ ji is tough and i@@ va@@ k@@ te@@ v is f@@ lying very high above us you understand me
by allah it has i@@ va@@ k@@ te@@ v and he &apos;s scary brother what &apos;s with you

that ro@@ ger le@@ ma@@ i@@ re he &apos;s not coming he with@@ d@@ re@@ w from coming to tunisia
he said his wife told him enough co@@ ac@@ hing for you
because he re@@ tired from co@@ ac@@ hing
it &apos;s that she wants him to bene@@ fit from his re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment he &apos;s done enough co@@ ac@@ hing you understand me
but it &apos;s a pity by allah he &apos;s a great coach
but there is no new coach who deser@@ ves to take l &apos;@@ e@@ to@@ i@@ le by allah god protect us
there is er@@ -@@ ra@@ gra@@ gu@@ i the one who
i dou@@ b@@ t it he may come he may not a little difficult
but if he comes to sousse he will clean it by allah he will clean in a sound way
yes and al-@@ fa@@ th honestly is a great team and plays a very beautiful soccer
and if i can add something he &apos;s a young coach and he can still give and teach
not a coach who would stick it and stop there
by allah what you &apos;re saying is true but one has to be patient that &apos;s all
we take our own mea@@ su@@ ring
when you re@@ cover from the game we can show it to him that six to one from the al-@@ ah@@ ly
or else it will get real me@@ ss@@ y
i swear by allah a scandal it was a scandal
until now i get all dis@@ gu@@ sted when i remember it by my brother &apos;s head it &apos;s like i &apos;m telling you
i su@@ f@@ fo@@ ca@@ te when i remember that day
they brought us players who had to be dra@@ gged by us and our nerves were ra@@ w by allah there was nothing
the players % pw el-@@ bri@@ z@@ i from l &apos;@@ e@@ to@@ i@@ le

that &apos;s it i thought of buying it like using it a bit till i buy a car
a la@@ mb@@ or@@ gh@@ in@@ i like fer@@ r@@ ar@@ i something like that you understand when i &apos;ll
i thought of buying something for like two hundred three hundred thousand dinars to spend time with it till something good comes you understand
exactly series four gr@@ and cop@@ y i mean it &apos;s not really expensive two hundred one hundred and thirty
yeah yeah i &apos;m going to wan@@ der around with it a bit you already know i get tired i &apos;ll be bothe@@ red if i buy a small car this one is big comfortable and everything
so it &apos;ll be use@@ ful for me wh@@ er@@ ever i go plus
it &apos;s good it &apos;s good even for its app@@ ear@@ ance it &apos;s not bad you understand i &apos;ll buy it in ma@@ tt@@ e blue is ma@@ tt@@ e blue good
yeah the ma@@ tt@@ e blue is really amazing otherwise ford series four there &apos;s that one ja@@ gu@@ ar they &apos;ve relea@@ sed new cars x@@ e you understand e e
you understand like that don &apos;t say x e e you need to mi@@ mi@@ c them e
say x e e exactly it &apos;s like that also exactly this one is not expensive it costs one hundred and fifty thousand dinars they said they had made it for those poor people who &apos;d want to buy a ja@@ gu@@ ar
you understand
you understand no not i &apos;m not going to the der@@ by anyways
i was saying
because i don &apos;t like the stadium i don &apos;t like the stadium you already know whatnot but i don &apos;t like it the stadium now bothe@@ rs me
i mean it &apos;s now a scen@@ e of sa@@ va@@ ger@@ y you understand
there are actually grou@@ ps
grou@@ ps i don &apos;t like to see those scen@@ es they bother me i mean in my country and everything i mean i don &apos;t like it i like to go and enjoy it i watched a match of in@@ ter and mi@@ la@@ n last time
i mean a fe@@ sti@@ v@@ al a fe@@ sti@@ v@@ al i mean you &apos;re able to watch it the op@@ ening and that order and that c@@ le@@ an@@ ness and whatnot on a sunday night at night
you understand at that time you already know i like in@@ ter in@@ ter won i was in the au@@ di@@ ence at that time can you imagine me i mean i didn &apos;t sit in the lower ti@@ er eating i sat in the u@@ pp@@ er ti@@ er s@@ eating and it &apos;s clean c@@ le@@ an@@ er than our lower ti@@ er s@@ eating
for us some people would gather each other and come sit next to us in the lower ti@@ er s@@ eating i turned around once to find someone who was actually blue i think he &apos;s called la@@ ssa@@ ad bou@@ kh@@ r@@ is something like that you know
he was next to me there at that time can you imagine everyone there would gather each other and go i don &apos;t agree to watch such scen@@ es would i pay more than one thousand dinars i mean to come see such people
who are m@@ y@@ st@@ eri@@ ous m@@ y@@ st@@ eri@@ ous and those bra@@ ts would be like they say they &apos;re not allo@@ wed to come in all of them come in it &apos;s crazy you know and there &apos;d actually be the@@ ft and cu@@ tting and people bea@@ ting each other after the match

i choose that one that costs nine hundred millimes i mean it doesn &apos;t work at all you know it only lasts one week
with all the coming in and out
i don &apos;t have
i used up nine hundred millimes without even watching vi@@ de@@ os or anything
au@@ to@@ ma@@ ti@@ cally no but i swi@@ pe away i don &apos;t focus on them you see
i try to swi@@ pe away from them and not to stop at them it &apos;s the same it doesn &apos;t last
one week &apos;s worth of internet ac@@ c@@ ess would cost me three to four dinars i mean it would cost me five dinars
i end up saying that it would &apos;ve been better if i had that ten dinars per month thing
no but i still have some left on it you would say after eleven
i &apos;m using it so ca@@ re@@ fully
yes after eleven
those are fra@@ u@@ ds too girl they used to they give two gi@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ tes right
it used to last so long you know sometimes one month would go by and i wouldn &apos;t even finish it all
and i would watch c@@ ds and stuff every day
now i remember there was this one month
three months ago
sometimes they count in the next month for me to finish one gi@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ te
they would give free online ac@@ c@@ ess without actually finishing the month
it &apos;s like i used up to twenty-five gi@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ tes and it &apos;s not even a month and a half already
i actually didn &apos;t do much with them i watched like two mo@@ vi@@ es
good old times

and i have a to@@ o@@ th that i got done in j@@ an@@ uary something like that
but it kept hurting me almost in brief ah i don &apos;t che@@ w on the right side because i &apos;m so afraid that it may break
can you hear me
did you understand me in brief i kept planning to go on until i couldn &apos;t anymore that &apos;s it the pain was too much i could feel it in my thro@@ at
i went to him he told me that he can &apos;t do anything he told me that the wi@@ s@@ dom to@@ o@@ th is s@@ wo@@ llen and there is p@@ us coming out of it under@@ n@@ ea@@ th
and another to@@ o@@ th it &apos;s already s@@ wo@@ llen he told me how % pw can you sleep at night you have dou@@ ble the pain

i &apos;ll go back to him on monday in brief i did an x@@ -@@ r@@ ay
so you have to get them pu@@ lled you have to have an operation to pu@@ ll out the wi@@ s@@ dom te@@ e@@ th don &apos;t even ar@@ gue about it
plus it &apos;s so s@@ wo@@ llen so that swe@@ lling and that p@@ us have to go away and ah
i have i have two on top one is fully complete i pu@@ lled it out four four years ago
one is complete it &apos;s not bothe@@ ring me it &apos;s on top well my to@@ o@@ th became un@@ even a little bit un@@ even did you get me
i feel like but the bottom ones the bottom ones are well so they are so ti@@ gh@@ t
the bottom ones are s@@ wo@@ llen and they are app@@ ear@@ ing
ah when they app@@ ear % pw
yes they have been like that for years there was a period of time they % pw % pw came through the skin a little bit
and the top of it app@@ ea@@ red
the top app@@ ears then it st@@ ops it stays stays stays like that then comes back
no it &apos;s ok but but you know what gets on my nerves you feel like you wanna pu@@ ll it out

it su@@ c@@ ks it &apos;s getting on my nerves
no i have space for the top ones not like the bottom ones
i don &apos;t have much space but they can come out
not like the bottom ones
pu@@ ll it out before it comes out when you have an operation you &apos;ll find it inside you won &apos;t feel it
it &apos;s inside and see how it comes out it doesn &apos;t go out like the other straight up it comes out le@@ an@@ ing
anyway it will come out from the si@@ des did you get me
that &apos;s why you have to pu@@ ll it out before it ah you have to get an operation you can &apos;t si@@ mp@@ ly pu@@ ll it out because it &apos;s under the skin
before your te@@ e@@ th get worse ah just prepare two hundred dinars because ah % pw
i mean for the operation
it &apos;s a small operation did you understand me
like that you save yourself now it &apos;s gonna cost you all of about eight hundred dinars or so better than ah
listen huh what did you tell me
that &apos;s it yeah it &apos;s a sunday
so much work
as is usual for mon@@ days
it &apos;s tough yeah
well the first time that we bought the things i had the clothes su@@ it@@ cases on top of the war@@ dro@@ be
so it got heavy
so we took them down i told them please help me see what i have and sort things out
i found i mean that i have some big ba@@ gs and all and those
those weren &apos;t simple they aren &apos;t
i felt that i had a lot of things you know what i mean
they &apos;re new i got them for my wedding
but i felt as we say it &apos;s a bit too much and they &apos;re not like those stuff i don &apos;t know like normal
so i thought i could probably sell them
i do like them i mean they &apos;re barely used they &apos;re lovely but when i go inside and see the ba@@ gs
yeah when i go in and see all my ba@@ gs and all the stuff that i have and everything i feel old out of fashi@@ on
yeah i wanna buy one of those back@@ pac@@ ks do you know them
i liked this one at zar@@ a it was for sixty dinars
pri@@ me d &apos;@@ or yes yes
but it &apos;s a little expensive
that &apos;s good it &apos;s pretty much for free
i feel like it &apos;s expensive i don &apos;t know
yes and does it have that small ban@@ do@@ li@@ er to carry it like a hand@@ bag can you
ah i got you
yes yes
yes one isn &apos;t used to it
i don &apos;t like going to those places at all even sou@@ k@@ ra i &apos;d like to go to them
yes yes yes
no it doesn &apos;t work
i didn &apos;t buy any clothes at all i was planning on buying some but i &apos;m still strugg@@ ling to
um they &apos;re ca@@ su@@ al just everyday ca@@ su@@ al clothes
i have a craving for that bor@@ dea@@ u@@ x and those ta@@ mp@@ on sle@@ ev@@ es
well the fabri@@ c that will remain i have that shirt that i bought from the fle@@ a market
i have a te@@ x@@ ti@@ le shirt i have to go to tunis and buy that mo@@ ti@@ f and % pw
anyway it &apos;s a big f@@ us@@ s from all si@@ des
yes once i bought these je@@ ans from the market for half a dinar
i put those pa@@ tches li@@ p@@ stick and fa@@ ke@@ -@@ je@@ wel@@ ry on them
i swear to god i had to
re@@ se@@ w them by myself at home i felt like wearing them in the morning
so i se@@ wed them myself the se@@ wing was alright
i can se@@ w
well i told you i just felt lazy they were in that state for i don &apos;t know how long i have pur@@ cha@@ sed those st@@ r@@ ings so i did and those things
and i left there for days i thought about taking it every day
