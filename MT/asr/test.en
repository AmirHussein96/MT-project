ah this year i don &apos;t work normally on eid al-fitr
but there &apos;s a problem you know that which ah
inas has a son a son as we say a baby and the first year that is she would spend eid with him you get it
so she wants to be with her son on the day of eid get it
and i after all what do i have on eid &apos;s day i have nothing i can work on eid &apos;s day and not work on the usual days
% pw i don &apos;t want to make it worse
it means ah you wouldn &apos;t tell me by force please you wouldn &apos;t tell me work
i told you you wouldn &apos;t ask me to work on the day of eid
you by force get it it means i i should tell her about your son i have nothing to do with him on eid &apos;s day i spend all day long sleeping get it
yes it means i do chores i feel
if i wasn &apos;t working i would have spent all day asleep i would go in the afternoon
ah to the house ah to grandma &apos;s house get it it means i have nothing to do with a whole day
whether i work or not is the same maybe i sleep i might wake up a bit late in the morning that &apos;s why
get it anyway when sunday comes the problem gets solved for everyone
the second day of eid remains
hello do you hear me
the second day of eid remains so that second day of eid ah
ah it means we start dividing it a group works in the morning and a group works in the afternoon
and it doesn &apos;t bother me i want to work in the afternoon and stay asleep late n the morning
i go out at four thirty

i got you yes
you think
yes okay unless you divide them that is as we say in the morning she gets him to spend eid with him and in the afternoon he would be with you to spend the night or you take him in late afternoon and he spends the night with you get it

i mean it &apos;s ok did you understand me
her kids joined me now it &apos;s a big problem
for real it &apos;s an amount that takes two people to get it washed why would i wash it by myself
no that &apos;s too much it became too much and those dishes are big and too heavy you know
yes the other time i had my iftar there you know we were three together and i and i rinsed the dishes
and then
she does after i scraped the dishes and washed them and everything
she washes it with bleach and detergent and i rinse it again and put it
i put it to drain and sabrine dries it
i mean it &apos;s like that so we can finish it on time

that &apos;s it
yes i &apos;m going out
i just woke up i go out every night
i mean almost the same rhythm that &apos;s it i sleep a lot during ramadan
i &apos;m always sleepy and i go to work
that &apos;s it ah that &apos;s it what was i going to tell you
i mean that tiredness during ramadan
that &apos;s better
did you go
believe me that &apos;s the best thing you did
see if you went you would deeply regret it
really on saturday or saturday
i mean luckily there was on the fifteenth night of ramadan the day of the fifteenth not the night of the fifteenth
ah with all that ah you can &apos;t even find a place to stand up let alone sit down
you can &apos;t stand up
too crowded there is a hadra concert or i don &apos;t know what a kharja or a ziara

yes me too
no no i can &apos;t find a place on those stairs i always sit in ah
i know i know i go there every day i was there yesterday and the day before
i have to go there twice or three times in week
do you think that you can find a place on the stairs we found a place just one time down the stairs ah no i &apos;m talking in the middle of the week but the last saturday you can &apos;t even dream about finding a place on the stairs
i mean it &apos;s so luxurious
i mean you would be lucky if you found a place on the stairs
at all i don &apos;t even dare to think about it until ah a place is empty on the stairs see that space where people walk in the middle of the stairs it &apos;s full of people
as if they were sitting in the theater of carthage
next to each other right
yes that &apos;s it
oh my god what was i going to say what shoes the black ones i liked them a lot
you can go out with them
no you can go out wearing them they &apos;re not sparkly
the &apos;yre not velvet they &apos;re shiny like a dish
i told you that because they have a flash yes
yes but you can go out wearing them every day and by every day i don &apos;t mean like on the street you can wear them when you go out somewhere
not to be worn in the evening yes not to be worn in the evening or to weddings ah or yes
even the other ones are not bad
it &apos;s not like the way they look i like them even the other one of course i like them even more
but the others are a different design design design and ah i mean they &apos;re nice i liked them i liked both of them
and they are big did ines give birth
and ah ah then they will not fit her did you understand
she didn &apos;t even wear them she didn &apos;t wear them at all i mean she bought them in london and she brought them to tunis
i mean when she wanted to wear them now none of them fit her
maybe she gained weight after giving birth
she stayed yes
that &apos;s it so ah
yes no it &apos;s nice it &apos;s nice
and there &apos;s no way you can find in tunis you will find it for at least twenty ninety dinars
yes yes no so it &apos;s so nice ah price and quality it &apos;s so nice i mean i saw it and i touched it there are no ah
it has no flaws
what did you do about the dentist
i can hear you i can hear
i didn &apos;t get any
are there four
same here they have been swollen for years
me too they are appearing
yes and you have no wisdom tooth pain i mean is that normal
it gets on my nerves yes i know it it feels like
it feels like you have tooth decay or or sometimes it feels like you have tooth decay and they hurt
one of them started to show up on the left on the left it started to appear
but it made my bottom teeth uneven i mean my bottom teeth got worse i mean i was going to have to get one on the top so now it &apos;s even worse
and the other one is so so so swollen it didn &apos;t come out yet not even its top appeared
and i have no idea about the top ones i can &apos;t feel them
yes yes they will become uneven
it will be uneven at the bottom
it &apos;s already uneven it &apos;ll get more uneven did you get me
i have to pull it out before it comes out
do you mean that i have to do it before my teeth get worse
i understand yes no i have to get it because ah
i mean something is going is going in the wrong way
before i end up having braces worth five thousand dinars right
yes
better than struggling with having braces i mean losing money and
yes hi
hi hello fine thanking god and you
are you home
hum didn &apos;t you go to work today
so you took a nap i see
it &apos;s better
i &apos;m well well well
no i was on vacation yesterday today it &apos;s a day off
there is no work
it &apos;s all about us waiting for the training the work is on hold because the software that we used to work with has changed
so my boss said i could take two days off
so i took them i didn &apos;t take them in a row on purpose
i took a monday on purpose close to the weekend
a long weekend
that was the last monday and i got yesterday
because if i take two days off in a row
that is about the weekend i could
yes exactly it &apos;s going to be too much i will remember all of my problems
i was like it &apos;s okay i will have this day in the middle
so the week wouldn &apos;t seem so long i was like okay i &apos;ll work for three days and get back
that &apos;s it
seriously ramadan is not good for working really
i would sleep at around midday one o &apos;clock
i would sleep at around midday one o &apos;clock
then wake up i don &apos;t know like cook and help in the kitchen and all
then go out and get home with the kid
the rest of the day repeat i mean i just watched them in the evening that &apos;s all
that &apos;s all
i used to spend ramadan like that that &apos;s how i spent it then then i would watch % pw
almost all of the series i would keep repeating them until the morning i repeated them
i sleep at nine
just like that yes you repeat everything
that &apos;s it that &apos;s better
please tell me how is the three-g treating you
does it cost much i mean does it take up so much
didn &apos;t you get the feeling that it costs a lot
everybody is complaining about it
i think it &apos;s done on purpose for ramadan
i had in the balance ten dinars the other time
i got ten dinars and i put
i made that one-month offer that flexy too it lasts for
but the month would go by the thirty days will be over and i hadn &apos;t even used it up yet i don &apos;t finish it all
it wasn &apos;t even one week and it ended
it would be like for two days the nine-hundred-millimes offer
i tried that only once
the problem is with facebook
even if you don &apos;t open videos they would open automatically because that thing without a sound uses up units
i try to swipe away from them but it gets it it just has to
did you remove the key or did you leave it
you know it &apos;s
ah there
ah it &apos;s unlimited after eleven yes yes
to my knowledge they are frauds
yes i used to watch them on my phone i would put on a movie and watch it i would repeat episodes and all
and would still get me through the month now you know i just had it last week
i watched the two or three episodes from the weekend because in the middle of the week i watch things at work you see
and sometimes when i don &apos;t go out i watch them here at home
and i watch them at work it &apos;s just for the weekend episodes
% pw because on saturday i go out on friday and saturday
i don &apos;t go out on sunday that is i use it for two days
two episodes
that weekend i had watched two episodes of flashback and two episodes of % pw and it was out
% pw i used to put on movies using it
well that &apos;s it
adsl is the best choice that &apos;s it but it doesn &apos;t work in our neighborhood they didn &apos;t get it yet
how much do you have left on it
i swear i forgot whether it was one or two years
it &apos;s a jam
it costs a hundred and twenty dinars per year
a hundred and twenty dinars per year and you would
it won &apos;t get jammed or anything
for telecom you have to for telecom one needs a telecom line
yes that &apos;s it
you have to get a line do you have a line
do you a telecom line
yeah then you can get it
you see it will cost less thirty dinars how much does the other one cost each month
it &apos;s great it &apos;s great multiply it by twelve
multiply it by twelve
it &apos;s going to be more than two hundred and forty it &apos;s more than two hundred and forty
you see it &apos;s more than two hundred and forty it &apos;s going to be two hundred and fifty-two dinars
you see two hundred and fifty-two dinars
it &apos;s less it &apos;s less that is it &apos;s a maximum of a hundred and eighty thousand that could get you great adsl and wi-fi connection that won &apos;t be jammed
you see you will save like seventy or eighty dinars
there are phones in the neighborhood
now after all
and you know that my laptop was stolen then then and i &apos;m not planning on buying another one
i mean there is no use
actually well i need it sometimes i &apos;ll be stuck in the room i need to watch something it &apos;s not practical
yes and i have like this thing
you see i want something big that gets you to focus more
like usual
that &apos;s all it looks like it &apos;s going to be hot today
i didn &apos;t go out
it &apos;s obvious it &apos;s hot inside the house
start using you start using like this thing
try to use like a hat that thing
i see yes
because a hat would cover your face too
ah no it doesn &apos;t cover your hands
i did it last year i &apos;m getting lazy
i did it last year i had this one to use when i was walking they were okay i mean they lasted until july
then i used this thing
is it hot now or not
you know i get moles too
i got tanned i got so tanned may hands are so dark
you see i don &apos;t pay attention i didn &apos;t put on sunscreen from the beginning
that &apos;s it no it &apos;s over you see it &apos;s like i had one of these tans
i once tried to get a tan at the pool without using
like in vain
no it worked for me it worked for me i told you i had a tan just like that
i mean i didn &apos;t swim and i got a tan
just like that you see but it was fresh then it wasn &apos;t like beach time it &apos;s not like a beach it would be hotter still
that &apos;s it
god is the only god and mohamed is his messenger
i didn &apos;t go out
he came over to your house
hello yes hi are you doing fine
how are you doing are you feeling tired
huh what did you tell me
i said are you feeling tired
i myself i swear to god did know i &apos;ll be sleeping i mean it wasn &apos;t necessary i woke up late and all so i fell asleep
i woke up not feeling well and i &apos;ll have to work very late at night
how boring and stale is ramadan but ramadan isn &apos;t the real reason
it &apos;s such a drag i swear to god how boring is that day
that &apos;s it i saw that you uploaded some pictures in the group
you don &apos;t wear them
you don &apos;t wear them i said you don &apos;t wear them
ah i understand yes
well you probably didn &apos;t feel the same about them when you were about to buy them you probably felt they were awesome and very lovely when you were going to buy them
you grew tired of them now
yes i understand yes
that &apos;s true so you start to feel like selling them i understand yes
i bought one myself well it doesn &apos;t look like a backpack when you look at it
i bought it from prime d &apos;or did you hear about it prime d &apos;or
tunisie mall also has it
they have it
no i bought them during the sale i swear to god the sale in
in late april or the start of may something like that do you get it
a seventy percent i bought it for forty-five dinars do you get it
i &apos;ll show you pictures of it later when i look at it it has the shape of a backpack but i wear it on the side
it doesn &apos;t work when i wear it on my back
look you know that one that you carry from the top
the strap when you look at a big strap of a backpack the bag is actually big you see that strap that you put on your back to carry it from i put that one on my shoulder
and it has two two big stamps you know it &apos;s all black leather but it looks like a backpack i wear it to the side in the exact shape of a backpack
but it &apos;s carried to the side because there &apos;s one like it that &apos;s carried on the back but it doesn &apos;t seem practical you know
it &apos;s exactly the same i mean but it &apos;s carried
it doesn &apos;t seem practical to me but it looks like it looks like a backpack i bought those sneakers at the time as well during the sale they were for ninty-nine and went down to thirty-five
it was by chance i had no idea that asma found out about it
i got it for thirty-five while it was
for a hundred dinars i got it for thirty-five and the bag was for ninety-nine and got it for forty-seven i think the sneakers had some hay on the bottom
just some not much and you know those old kids &apos; sandals from back in the day those baby sandals with holes in them
just like that but they have those % pw silver sprinkles on the front you know
and from the back it &apos;s normal white just normal
it &apos;s sole is white and there are dry leaves on it not dry leaves it &apos;s like camel hay
i sounds like a good deal to me for thirty-five and all
the bag is black the bag is black i actually don &apos;t own a black bag in the first place the one i own has gotten old you know
so i have just one that &apos;s % pw and i wanted to change it so i didn &apos;t have the opportunity to buy a black bag
i don &apos;t it &apos;ll be around eighty
so i found and got this one it both works as a black bag and a backpack that &apos;s it
i mean if i &apos;d buy some more
yes it &apos;s the same for me
i &apos;m having trouble too because i go out every night during ramadan and my problem is that i can &apos;t find any top-wear to my liking you know there isn &apos;t any fashionable top-wear
shoes and all aren &apos;t a problem
so very much so yes it feels like shirts are very much so not they &apos;re coming up with those floral
bordeaux i got some for five dinars for five dinars you buy them and take them to the tailor ask him to iron them and they &apos;ll get attached
the shirt i said your shirt
it &apos;s not like that i have a dress that i &apos;m gonna do the same for
yes the small motif costs three dinars and the big motif costs five dinars
do you get it and you take them to the tailor he &apos;d pass the iron over the top of them it &apos;ll get attached
yes that &apos;s good and did you sew them or did you take them to the tailor to iron them
but even if you take them take them to the tailor to steam them with his hot iron they &apos;d get attached
yes i didn &apos;t know about them i actually thought
that &apos;s good yes i myself thought it was sewn i had no idea
rim told me that
he also has my shirt i still didn &apos;t get it from him
i mean the jeans i already have bought those three lipsticks one is a lipstick and i don &apos;t know what the other one is
birdy will attach the other one for me % pw i didn &apos;t get them i didn &apos;t see how they have become that &apos;s it
that &apos;s it listen do you want
because i got six and then i ran into trouble with sabri because of one of them
so i mean i &apos;m asking you if you want itof the pants
it &apos;s expensive honestly
it &apos;s price went down during the sale it has gotten to forty-five
do you know them or not look look i &apos;m gonna tell the story behind them why i wanted to get them
asma last year had a brown and pink one it &apos;s amazing
i &apos;m not sure how but i took it from her once while she went on vacation i had it for a whole month i was getting coffee in it
not a single drop was spilled
she would be frisking the bag and not a single drop would spill because there would be a lot of these things they were selling i don &apos;t know what i mean it would fall down and get spilled
i liked it but it got stolen from her anyway
that &apos;s it so i had to get one of them
when i asked her and all she told me that their price had dropped to forty-five because they used to be expensive they used to sell for sixty
their price came down to forty-five and add to it that it &apos;s pistachio green and white
it &apos;s not like the other one brown with pink is better
she asked about some for me i told her try and find me a brown one so when she found none i ordered three
one for imen one for leila and one for me the other girl it looks like the other girl had let us down you know
and i can &apos;t afford to run into trouble with sabri so i thought if you &apos;d want to of course otherwise
i &apos;ll look around myself no and i also was barely able to add it to imen &apos;s thing
i was barely able to add it to imen &apos;s thing i myself will be paying it in two tranches
let &apos;s say a tranche for fifty-five for this month and a tranche for fifty-five for next month because i &apos;ll add it to imen &apos;s bill
it &apos;s not it &apos;s just one lot i mean you know
because the one that belongs to other girl is added to her bill
mine is added to her bill and imen also has another bill already and if i have to pay the forty-five in just one month then no that would be too much for me because
i used it it was amazing it didn &apos;t get spilled at all
so i will split a tranche of fifty-five into two months
that &apos;s it you don &apos;t have to i just told you and that &apos;s it
yes yes it &apos;s tough in that case
i don &apos;t get in the first place and you won &apos;t find that thermos anywhere i thought it would be once and for all i mean
i &apos;ll attach mine otherwise i won &apos;t get it by itself
i prefer a cute something to wear it &apos;s better
yes also i mean you &apos;d find that she had a lot when you go there
you find them ready already she should just send their pictures
that &apos;s it they don &apos;t of buying things
it &apos;s always like that i told you they don &apos;t get tired of buying stuff i &apos;m serious
i myself don &apos;t anymore but sometimes some things would tempt me
that &apos;s it how much would we leave on the side anyway by your mother
and i &apos;d like to buy some new top-wear and i &apos;d like to buy some new foot-wear like that i feel like i &apos;m naked i don &apos;t have anything

to choose and to take a look by herself
did you say that it &apos;s for large amounts
she still doesn &apos;t know i i was just assuming
i mean i was just supposing but i think that she knows how could she not know that that one is for large amounts i mean if she ordered it then she totally needs it do you understand
i mean i think that she knows
yes because i don &apos;t think that she i mean i don &apos;t think that she will put food in it to store it it &apos;s obvious that she needs it for a large quantity
okay okay i will ask her i will tell her about the colors she doesn &apos;t know that
okay i will tell her about the available colors okay i will tell her
hold on
okay
that one that &apos;s for the butter as i told you no the butter

i understood yes
i don &apos;t know i will explain it to them that those are for cheese not for butter
well it &apos;s the same for god &apos;s sake what &apos;s the difference

no no the problem here is that the muscle is stretching
so when you exercise
your muscle enlarges
are you following or no
what about you are you going to register or no
yes may god be with you
tell me how you do it
no no
so are you going to take training courses or no
what will you choose
hamida school they teach italian painting and that stuff and there is plaster normally
no no this italian painting
is good-for-nothing
the best thing you go for is go for plaster
go for plaster training courses
it &apos;s money-spinning
and if you are fond of it go for it
you already have to catch on quick
and to pay close attention
to learn the profession
you have to catch on quick
a plaster career is money-spinning but the italian painting is just like any other painting
not a big difference
from normal painting
i don &apos;t know i think there is andalusian plaster or moroccan moroccan
normally i mean you have to choose a specialty
there is andalusian
there is moroccan
i don &apos;t know or maybe they are the same
but plus
i &apos;ll send you pictures later
see how great they are
the problem is that one meter can even cost can even cost
one hundred fifty dinars for one meter
no see
how much are you going to gain
use your mind
italian plaster they say
if you go for plaster if you go for
it would be better for you if you go for plaster
this is a piece of advice from a brother
no no no don &apos;t
your future is what matters
and i only have to advise you
i don &apos;t care about your choice
i said it and you
it &apos;s up to you if you want to go for plaster go for it
if you want to
go for italian painting go for it
it &apos;s doesn &apos;t bother me the most important thing is that you
choose something you love
normally you are following are you following or no
then please bro step on it and don &apos;t
start postponing it daily you better step on it are you following
ok ok i &apos;ll call you my bro i &apos;ll already call you or if you need anything you can call me

it doesn &apos;t bode well if we don &apos;t win this game
it would be a catastrophe remember to say he said it
by the great allah by the great allah
it &apos;s a strange thing i have doubts to be honest i have doubts that they win this game
because el-tarajji is tough and ivaktev is flying very high above us you understand me
by allah it has ivaktev and he &apos;s scary brother what &apos;s with you
and htira is one of the best professionals
and it &apos;s bringing it has el-khenissi and it &apos;s bringing er-rouge
what &apos;s his name el-ferjani sassi
and el-badri it has ivaktev and he &apos;s scary brother
without that ivaktev the young ones it has
it &apos;s honestly a young lineup and quite successful
el-binzarti will make it run into a wall
and we have to make some saves and we &apos;ll get through
that roger lemaire he &apos;s not coming he withdrew from coming to tunisia
he said his wife told him enough coaching for you
because he retired from coaching
it &apos;s that she wants him to benefit from his retirement he &apos;s done enough coaching you understand me
but it &apos;s a pity by allah he &apos;s a great coach
but there is no new coach who deserves to take l &apos;etoile by allah god protect us
there is er-ragragui the one who
i doubt it he may come he may not a little difficult
but if he comes to sousse he will clean it by allah he will clean in a sound way
yes and al-fath honestly is a great team and plays a very beautiful soccer
and if i can add something he &apos;s a young coach and he can still give and teach
not a coach who would stick it and stop there
by allah what you &apos;re saying is true but one has to be patient that &apos;s all
we take our own measuring
when you recover from the game we can show it to him that six to one from the al-ahly
or else it will get real messy
i swear by allah a scandal it was a scandal
until now i get all disgusted when i remember it by my brother &apos;s head it &apos;s like i &apos;m telling you
i suffocate when i remember that day
they brought us players who had to be dragged by us and our nerves were raw by allah there was nothing
the players % pw el-brizi from l &apos;etoile
or abderrazaq or ziad abu-battan
true by allah true you pleased me when you said walid azrou had a share in this
he &apos;s a clumsy offense player who scores one and misses many by allah what you &apos;re saying is true he had a share in it
and that &apos;s it our history has been soiled
and a scandal you cannot forget by allah
by allah a scandal a scandal out scandal that one
by allah it &apos;s a scandal do you understand me or not a scandal a scandal
by allah my friends at the college rubbed real good on me
and i hated it so that i didn &apos;t go to the college for two days
oh this is how i enter and they say the father of six has just arrived
i come and one says we are going home at six and ten minutes get it on own by allah it &apos;s as i &apos;m telling you
that &apos;s it by allah that &apos;s it i &apos;ve just told you if they play better today &apos;s game we take as a reference
if the ball play is better and they will win the game convincingly
or it &apos;s a big mess and the association gets and remember to tell me that i told you so
it &apos;s that hey and god protect us i &apos;m seriously worried it &apos;s going to be a mess
because he &apos;s put it a lineup which inspires no confidence and may god protect us
confusion set in and he &apos;s playing % pw look by yourself and judge
you see how it is by allah it &apos;s very strange
how is that but he &apos;s having acosta and marii play together
charmiti is playing on the bench he &apos;s not
but he has given up on % pw in three times he wants to revive the memories
but they will get rid of him and prepare you can understand on your own
you see how by allah it &apos;s strange
he &apos;s a son of the association and he cares about the association
and they go and have the five cents kids play the ones who don &apos;t deserve it and who won &apos;t hold up
by allah it &apos;s strange
but the problem will repeat itself because the association still has brokers inside it who
she said don &apos;t hang up we are trying to reach the person you are calling

marwen was somehow nervous and he said i am going home they went home
sabri went home when he was going to fix his things he saw the car so he called marwen and he told him the car is in front of the house
marwen reproved him and acted as if he was angry and he told him i am going home
and i will see what is that
he made as if he was going to start a fight
sabri was calling him but he didn &apos;t respond
he was calling him but he didn &apos;t respond he was calling him but he ended the call he sent him messages and in the end he told him my son give me the man &apos;s money
and let &apos;s close the subject
when you were at the glass shop when you went to the frag

at that time marwen twil suddenly came and sabri took his money and he was about to hit him
then marwen went

yes good anyway i felt you know that my sixth sense was telling me that there was something wrong
there was something wrong when we were coming to you in
i told him that sabri was angry and i would hit marwen
did you understand so he called him and i wanted to be in a fight a saturday can &apos;t called a saturday if there are no fights
i asked him to call him and he came near the bakery
they were going to talk but watad came as if he wanted to fix the issue
he got with him in the car and sabri remained outside and sabri remained outside
they were talking and talking and the they reached a conclusion that it was what
that watad will visit his father in the hospital in la marsa
so it wouldn &apos;t appear to be a lie and so on he said
he turned to sabri and told him if my mom is at home we will not go if my mom is not at home we will go anyway his way of talking was tricky
after they went i turned to sabri and i told him actually i will tell you something but do not get upset there is something wrong and they are planning something
did you understand yes it is good i told him do not get upset
he told me he muttered and he thought of something
he took the mobile phone and he called marwen and told him where are you he answered him i am at khaled &apos;s house

they stopped the car in front of us so sabri turned to him and told him we have nothing to do aymen and i will go with you to the hospital we will go to visit his father there is no problem

and i don &apos;t know what else anyway
and one mango cost me five hundred and eighty eight dinars and six hundred
but it is not peeled i got upset because they didn &apos;t peel it
because normally they would peel it like a kiwi i can &apos;t take it you know if i put my hand on it and peel it that &apos;s not appropriate at a party
you see
yes yes that &apos;s it i got upset at the time the waiter came running and told me why you know
and so he peeled it for me with his hands
he sat next to me but i didn &apos;t let him he started with the first one but i thought it was shameful
you see let me finish telling you about rio de janeiro what is after the kiwi stand
after the kiwi stand they have fruits
i wonder what was the name of it like the lawyer avocado
avocado is actually a fruit anyway
its color is orange its color is orange
it looks like mango it &apos;s like a kiwi it &apos;s like oranges and it looks like a pineapple
it tastes like lemon
i see and i considered from from this logic that i would do
an avocado syrupy tobacco mix in tunis the biggest factory
i thought about buying all of the ouardya and i would take all the house and all those chaotic buildings and that
and i thought i would connect all of them together and all
would be together and i would work with them the avocado factory the biggest avocado factory in tunisia and north africa
anyway how how would it work would it work with solar energy
i see you are right without energy with the solar energy and in the winter time for example you wouldn &apos;t have solar energy i would give extra bonuses to the employees so that they would bike more
when they bike more they produce thermal energy
muscular energy you see
it would become a syrupy tobacco mix a hundred percent i mean all natural i mean it doesn &apos;t have any chemical waste no electricity and no gas waste
yes yes i have clients i have you know that rami from the selfie
that client is great honestly i never saw anyone like him
if % pw if you heard what he did what he did last time he likes doing
i mean that &apos;s not acceptable you do work with jihen we knew he was in a relationship with her i mean you see
i mean he wants to add another girl to work
and what &apos;s worse more bizarre and more crazy is that the other girl is also in a relationship with
and that &apos;s not not the story that &apos;s not the story the thing is both of them knew they were both going out with rami with him at the same time
uh what was he called casanova man % pw i never saw something like this i have never seen something like that honestly
i mean honestly he is great he is great i never saw anyone like him i was in awe
man sometime you will be walking you and your girlfriend will be walking in front of the coffee shop no i am hiring both of them
and both know about it what is this
yes you know now and if you like it great can you believe this story
that &apos;s it brother i heard the story khoukhou fahmi told me about it you see
yes raif yes even fahmi is already stubborn i mean
oh god if one day he takes off the hat you would faint
i am watching in in % pw they have copenhagen on
dartmoor is playing in germany guess who is playing with him

and vertonghenin is playing in in the axe
of belgium and another one from belgium his name is long hundlephil or something
ali is playing with them do you know ali

sidi bou ali beb alioua that ali plays chkobba and rummy you see they gave him a nickname
there some people from pakistan living in london i mean from there you see

they have they said they have a new one making the coffee they brought him from capetown capetown that is in south africa
they recruited him anyway i mean it depends what you like if you are not shy and you like coffee like that
it &apos;s good you see he has an amazing espresso man it &apos;s perfect with
i know it &apos;s dope and when you see you will want to nurse it for a little longer you see because it is a little i mean a shot

who &apos;s got who &apos;s got he &apos;s actually a mechanic in yasminette
he was like buy it it &apos;s not bad but he told me he could buy a better car
and then i &apos;m going to come to think like why
i &apos;m like why will i spend two hundred and eighty thousand or three hundred thousand dinars on a car i &apos;m like i &apos;ll buy series four
that goes from one hundred and eighty to two hundred thousand dinars fully loaded you understand
yeah i mean two hundred thousand dinars are not a big deal you understand plus i &apos;m like settling things with it you already know it &apos;s like that in tunisia
that &apos;s it i thought of buying it like using it a bit till i buy a car
a lamborghini like ferrari something like that you understand when i &apos;ll
i thought of buying something for like two hundred three hundred thousand dinars to spend time with it till something good comes you understand
exactly series four grand copy i mean it &apos;s not really expensive two hundred one hundred and thirty
yeah yeah i &apos;m going to wander around with it a bit you already know i get tired i &apos;ll be bothered if i buy a small car this one is big comfortable and everything
so it &apos;ll be useful for me wherever i go plus
it &apos;s good it &apos;s good even for its appearance it &apos;s not bad you understand i &apos;ll buy it in matte blue is matte blue good
yeah the matte blue is really amazing otherwise ford series four there &apos;s that one jaguar they &apos;ve released new cars xe you understand e e
you understand like that don &apos;t say x e e you need to mimic them e
say x e e exactly it &apos;s like that also exactly this one is not expensive it costs one hundred and fifty thousand dinars they said they had made it for those poor people who &apos;d want to buy a jaguar
you understand
you understand no not i &apos;m not going to the derby anyways
i was saying
because i don &apos;t like the stadium i don &apos;t like the stadium you already know whatnot but i don &apos;t like it the stadium now bothers me
i mean it &apos;s now a scene of savagery you understand
there are actually groups
groups i don &apos;t like to see those scenes they bother me i mean in my country and everything i mean i don &apos;t like it i like to go and enjoy it i watched a match of inter and milan last time
i mean a festival a festival i mean you &apos;re able to watch it the opening and that order and that cleanness and whatnot on a sunday night at night
you understand at that time you already know i like inter inter won i was in the audience at that time can you imagine me i mean i didn &apos;t sit in the lower tier eating i sat in the upper tier seating and it &apos;s clean cleaner than our lower tier seating
for us some people would gather each other and come sit next to us in the lower tier seating i turned around once to find someone who was actually blue i think he &apos;s called lassaad boukhris something like that you know
he was next to me there at that time can you imagine everyone there would gather each other and go i don &apos;t agree to watch such scenes would i pay more than one thousand dinars i mean to come see such people
who are mysterious mysterious and those brats would be like they say they &apos;re not allowed to come in all of them come in it &apos;s crazy you know and there &apos;d actually be theft and cutting and people beating each other after the match
so % pw i &apos;d rather go to watch in a place you know that &apos;s got you understand and i &apos;d be at ease
with my friends and everything you know i &apos;d make a reservation and everything i &apos;d actually watch in a place
you know otherwise the derby is already not fun anymore i left the ca scoring one with bizerte
and they scored three to one anyway and they scored the goal at the eighty fifth minute
they scored three to one for real they &apos;ve lost three to one with bizerte for real
in bizerte anyways those bizerte people were clapping hey hey hey as if they won the championship i don &apos;t understand what they &apos;re happy for the ca are a weak club though bizerte are better than them thirty seconds originally
you know but anyways what have you guys done with ben guerdane
ah i left them i left them winning one to nothing
at the seventy second minute but i don &apos;t know or is the broadcasting dual
meaning each television has its receiver a receiver outside and a receiver inside
meaning you can watch a match at once you understand
anyways i was saying i had seen sfax i mean from outside and i was inside i &apos;ve seen they had done a festival for the ca
having conceded three goals anyway you know and some good goals eh
and the third was a penalty one and i left sfax winning nothing to ben guerdane
there &apos;s a paper today shall i fill in a paper
okay there is there is today you know there &apos;s six papers and certainly there &apos;s
because they haven &apos;t been scoring anything in all their previous half-times
we &apos;ll do it hasn &apos;t got in vain in vain like in the coming in
and there &apos;s chelsea and coventry that one &apos;s obviously three plus
and there &apos;s what &apos;s it called there &apos;s another one oh god ah not azur but a match
yeah yeah and there &apos;s there &apos;s the jovic there &apos;s the jovic and barcelona
like yesterday
ah did you see yesterday the one of liverpool
they said in the locker room the coach was like i actually have cancer and this might be one of my last matches
you bet they brought him in today i saw him in an interview so you see they put in all of their effort
yeah three goals at the ninety second minute they scored the third goal of
i play twelve goals the goal of four to one and four to six
i won one hundred dinars and went on my way home
i could have been rested
ah khrod

i have nothing to do i &apos;m just sitting here and the boss went out to do something so i had to stay outside and the air conditioner is running inside my hearts aches because of it shoot
actually the goods are so amazing those car accessories
and he took the assistant who &apos;s with me he has work outside so i had to stay outside and you can &apos;t imagine how the office is inside
when i see it my heart aches
no not a car wash two repair shops that sell car accessories
fine i &apos;m hanging out here where are you
dear they &apos;re coming up with a ridiculous issue i &apos;m eliminated for the first semester do you understand i went and brought them a medical certificate that costs fifteen dinars thinking that the problem would be over
things went by and at the end i found myself eliminated and they told me not to come take a test except during the scheduled time that the eliminated people would take the exam at that time
there are already six of us
sister when i went i didn &apos;t find anybody i only found two guys and among them was that one raggeb who is from last year &apos;s group
he told me &apos; it &apos;s over nassrine there &apos;s a group who took the exam and we didn &apos;t&apos;
when i found that i was eliminated this semester i went to talk with her i told her &apos; madam my final word is that
the first semester i mean i worked so hard and people came to take the exam with the whole group
let me come and take the exam with them i &apos;m telling you now&apos;
&apos;no &apos; she said &apos; in the first semester i % pw let you do what you wanted but now there is no more playing&apos;
but aren &apos;t there only normally seventeen people who take the exams
now the group the group the group of alfar is normally with us
they take the exams for ten days i mean as if they take the exams in a room
if they study normally and they take the exam
the girl saw me and called me to come and take the exam
but then when i went to speak with hadya she told me &apos; in addition to the fact that you &apos;re taking the exam with them you &apos;ll take the exam after the aid&apos;
i didn &apos;t understand what am i going to take after the aid it &apos;s done i took them
and albar &apos;s group will normally take the exams they &apos;ll take them and study for them at the same time like that you know in this way did you understand i &apos;ll take it tomorrow
she told me &apos; no a month after the tenth &apos; she told me &apos; it &apos;s because you have other things to sit for that &apos;s why you &apos;re eliminated&apos;
but yeah that &apos;s the problem it &apos;s like i need to change my name and not put my name sahar albahri for them
and there is a part related to soccer that i studied this year
i &apos;ll do like that an underline in the summary and i &apos;ll go add it in the report

but the turmoil and me
what kind of procedures are these for god &apos;s sake after this i &apos;ll have to sit for the exam alone ah zied
i don &apos;t care about the grades anyway in the end in the end you can throw out the diploma

how
she said &apos; i won &apos;t come i &apos;m already in ben daha near zahrouni&apos;
she asked me to come to zahrouni &apos; damn you &apos; i told her &apos; you &apos;re already taking them for free consider yourself to be paying one dinar and five hundred millimes the cost of a taxi from sliman kahya to zahrouni&apos;
she told me &apos; you come and i &apos;ll pay it for you but i won &apos;t go to that place&apos;
&apos;it &apos;s fine &apos; i told her &apos; see you downtown&apos;

didn &apos;t i have an accident at the beginning of ramadan
i mean i had an accident at the beginning of ramadan
actually i went with my dad by motorcycle and a car hit us
it &apos;s just that our left sides were scraped up but thank god we weren &apos;t hurt much
it wasn &apos;t our fault we were passing by and he was talking with that man and he was about to turn and hit the % pw in the street
and as he was turning he hit the motorcycle wheel from behind
it was wild we turned two cars into a swing
but you know the problem my father was fasting and angry imagine that it was the first day of ramadan
he was bleeding like crazy from all over and he was going to beat the man
you can &apos;t imagine how i was i was crying now when i go past that place the kids start to imitate me saying &apos; don &apos;t do anything dad&apos;
&apos;come my leg hurts come take me &apos; and i was just pretending
but darling did that happen
dear the kids were near me you see where i used to work in the glass shop close to it i mean everybody knows me
imagine if my father had caused a problem and that man was obviously rich which means though he was at fault he could be considered to be a victim it would switch
and my dad hits hard if he just gets angry you can &apos;t imagine what he can do it &apos;d be normal for him to beat a child if he finds him
that &apos;s all &apos; and why you damned idiot damn you &apos; he told him &apos; are you insane&apos;
&apos;dad &apos; i told him when he was back home and had calmed down a little bit he was laughing at me and saying &apos; how did you scream it &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve seen you crying with finesse the first time&apos;
you know it &apos;s as if you &apos;re going to
oussama called me
the poor guy he always calls me it &apos;s me who is neglectful i don &apos;t call anybody already oh well it &apos;s only when my dad has a bonus and that &apos;s it it &apos;s going to be over
he talked with me and told me how it is and if so we &apos;ll meet on the second or third day of the aid
i told him it should be okay like that i mean he told me &apos; the problem is with me if they don &apos;t give me a day off&apos;
i mean &apos; we &apos;ll see the day oussama is free seriously and we &apos;ll go out and that &apos;s enough of your shit&apos;

ah you &apos;re on vacation today
yes okay that is it &apos;s a part of the break
that &apos;s better
no it &apos;s good especially during ramadan
no no not at all it &apos;s one of the most i i turned so blind
that &apos;s a plan
it &apos;s the same for me too you see on saturday
on saturday like today at night i don &apos;t sleep i only sleep at six or seven like that
at least you went out and you &apos;ve done something different you spent the night out
the series
i watch them and then i sleep in the afternoon on sundays
if
you know when i changed the key then i made it four-g
but it &apos;s not good just like like the phone
it does cost a lot
very much very much and my phone and i &apos;m on three
about that three-g it &apos;s not even four-g
yes it doesn &apos;t last
it doesn &apos;t last
i only go online i mean to check facebook messenger and that stuff
i choose that one that costs nine hundred millimes i mean it doesn &apos;t work at all you know it only lasts one week
with all the coming in and out
i don &apos;t have
i used up nine hundred millimes without even watching videos or anything
automatically no but i swipe away i don &apos;t focus on them you see
i try to swipe away from them and not to stop at them it &apos;s the same it doesn &apos;t last
one week &apos;s worth of internet access would cost me three to four dinars i mean it would cost me five dinars
i end up saying that it would &apos;ve been better if i had that ten dinars per month thing
no but i still have some left on it you would say after eleven
i &apos;m using it so carefully
yes after eleven
those are frauds too girl they used to they give two gigabytes right
it used to last so long you know sometimes one month would go by and i wouldn &apos;t even finish it all
and i would watch cds and stuff every day
now i remember there was this one month
three months ago
sometimes they count in the next month for me to finish one gigabyte
they would give free online access without actually finishing the month
it &apos;s like i used up to twenty-five gigabytes and it &apos;s not even a month and a half already
i actually didn &apos;t do much with them i watched like two movies
good old times
no they &apos;ve pushed it too far
nothing lasts anymore
yes now it &apos;s done you know the commitment to that key i thought about it the other time
you know he told me that it would last two years then right
i think it was two years you know they cut off the bill
yes i thought about the other time i was like
i would probably have that thing planet what is that
yes that &apos;s probably it % pw those things working with planet or something what are they called
you get telecom you
because the other ones like orange and
yes we have one upstairs
no now this thing sounds great to me
the was short when i made the commitment
we say it &apos;s great
now two hundred and
that &apos;s it yes
haha
no there is no use
i got it for studying back then i bought one that is used
i don &apos;t know
you would need it yes the phone is not practical if you want to watch stuff on big screens you know
that &apos;s it
yes
you didn &apos;t go out
yes i swear god is happy with you
please i took a cab and headed home we came together one step at a time till the doorstep
anyway i went in i went in and i put it down
i put on a scarf over my face for sun protection
when i was going out when i was going out i took off the scarf to go outside to meet him
i went back immediately
i felt like my brain was melting
i felt like there was a ball moving around in my head
the one from the park it &apos;s walking down the walkway
walking down the walkway i don &apos;t like that i say
i don &apos;t want to i just think that the most important thing is that the scarf is big enough for me to cover my face
and my hands and all
i don &apos;t like it
i don &apos;t have one
i do it on the beach like for flirting that &apos;s all
it &apos;s not about one o &apos;clock not yet as soon i feel like you see when it starts to get hot
when i feel like it &apos;s going to be hot i automatically
but it &apos;s almost just about that scorching sensation i can &apos;t take that
really
me too it doesn &apos;t work for me as it used to
just
i went out yesterday
me and houssem

no this is hard work but what i ah how is it i rinse it wash it and let it drain alone
we don &apos;t have the option of drying
no i keep watching it
yes you had a suggestion
there you go
yes good for you
i honestly couldn &apos;t i couldn &apos;t go out i went out the other saturday
he asked me to go to lac or sidi bou said or anywhere else
i told him no need the time we are going spend on the road is more than anything
i &apos;m so tired i didn &apos;t go i told him let &apos;s stay in a place here in megrine
we walk slowly i want to change the mood and stuff
see i was sleepy in the coffee shop i was about to start snoring
no no i know i deeply regret it each year and then i decide that i won &apos;t do it again
yes too much too much
ah in that ennejma or what are you talking about sidi bou said
yes in that ezzahra ennejma or whatever there was a ziara concert in that space
yes as usual as usual when i go there i sit on the stairs at that coffee shop el alia as you can &apos;t find a place ah
you can do that sneakily i was getting myself so close to people did you understand
you can &apos;t even dream about it yes
oh my god it &apos;s crowded
so nice i like % pw because it &apos;s velvet well i didn &apos;t like the black ones that much because ah
i mean new black high heels did you understand me
i mean i &apos;m not it &apos;s not in my plans i &apos;m not planning to buy black high heels
because they are new they are meant to be worn for special occasions i want to buy something sporty for every day
but i like them they &apos;re so nice and affordable and ah
no they &apos;re nice i mean they &apos;re original
yes yes you can wear them for a night out
no no i &apos;m telling you i mean % pw ah just ah
i promise i feel like classy style suits me better
she stayed yes like that
yes so nice she said that it &apos;s affordable and will never find that price elsewhere
no no no way and those are the trending colors for the replicas they bring them from turkey and i don &apos;t know what for ninety dinars
i can &apos;t even tell you about other brands i mean
girl i thought
so i told you that i paid i paid all my debts i mean i &apos;m clean
so i thought this month i will buy things and save them
i wanna buy i don &apos;t know something to wear on my feet jeans or something like that % pw i have nothing to wear at all
so nothing went as planned as you can see i went to that place
i mean i borrowed not even it &apos;s still half half did you understand
ah my wisdom tooth is hurting me my mouth is swollen did you get me
and i have a tooth that i got done in january something like that
but it kept hurting me almost in brief ah i don &apos;t chew on the right side because i &apos;m so afraid that it may break
can you hear me
did you understand me in brief i kept planning to go on until i couldn &apos;t anymore that &apos;s it the pain was too much i could feel it in my throat
i went to him he told me that he can &apos;t do anything he told me that the wisdom tooth is swollen and there is pus coming out of it underneath
and another tooth it &apos;s already swollen he told me how % pw can you sleep at night you have double the pain
i told him i sleep there
he asked me to do x-rays and he gave me antibiotics shots and i have to eat unsalted food
i &apos;ll go back to him on monday in brief i did an x-ray
so you have to get them pulled you have to have an operation to pull out the wisdom teeth don &apos;t even argue about it
plus it &apos;s so swollen so that swelling and that pus have to go away and ah
i have i have two on top one is fully complete i pulled it out four four years ago
one is complete it &apos;s not bothering me it &apos;s on top well my tooth became uneven a little bit uneven did you get me
i feel like but the bottom ones the bottom ones are well so they are so tight
the bottom ones are swollen and they are appearing
ah when they appear % pw
yes they have been like that for years there was a period of time they % pw % pw came through the skin a little bit
and the top of it appeared
the top appears then it stops it stays stays stays like that then comes back
no it &apos;s ok but but you know what gets on my nerves you feel like you wanna pull it out
you feel like you feel like something is tickling you or i don &apos;t know what
it sucks it &apos;s getting on my nerves
no i have space for the top ones not like the bottom ones
i don &apos;t have much space but they can come out
not like the bottom ones
pull it out before it comes out when you have an operation you &apos;ll find it inside you won &apos;t feel it
it &apos;s inside and see how it comes out it doesn &apos;t go out like the other straight up it comes out leaning
anyway it will come out from the sides did you get me
that &apos;s why you have to pull it out before it ah you have to get an operation you can &apos;t simply pull it out because it &apos;s under the skin
before your teeth get worse ah just prepare two hundred dinars because ah % pw
i mean for the operation
it &apos;s a small operation did you understand me
like that you save yourself now it &apos;s gonna cost you all of about eight hundred dinars or so better than ah
listen huh what did you tell me
that &apos;s it yeah it &apos;s a sunday
so much work
as is usual for mondays
it &apos;s tough yeah
well the first time that we bought the things i had the clothes suitcases on top of the wardrobe
so it got heavy
so we took them down i told them please help me see what i have and sort things out
i found i mean that i have some big bags and all and those
those weren &apos;t simple they aren &apos;t
i felt that i had a lot of things you know what i mean
they &apos;re new i got them for my wedding
but i felt as we say it &apos;s a bit too much and they &apos;re not like those stuff i don &apos;t know like normal
so i thought i could probably sell them
i do like them i mean they &apos;re barely used they &apos;re lovely but when i go inside and see the bags
yeah when i go in and see all my bags and all the stuff that i have and everything i feel old out of fashion
yeah i wanna buy one of those backpacks do you know them
i liked this one at zara it was for sixty dinars
prime d &apos;or yes yes
but it &apos;s a little expensive
that &apos;s good it &apos;s pretty much for free
i feel like it &apos;s expensive i don &apos;t know
yes and does it have that small bandolier to carry it like a handbag can you
ah i got you
yes yes
yes one isn &apos;t used to it
i don &apos;t like going to those places at all even soukra i &apos;d like to go to them
yes yes yes
no it doesn &apos;t work
i didn &apos;t buy any clothes at all i was planning on buying some but i &apos;m still struggling to
um they &apos;re casual just everyday casual clothes
i have a craving for that bordeaux and those tampon sleeves
well the fabric that will remain i have that shirt that i bought from the flea market
i have a textile shirt i have to go to tunis and buy that motif and % pw
anyway it &apos;s a big fuss from all sides
yes once i bought these jeans from the market for half a dinar
i put those patches lipstick and fake-jewelry on them
i swear to god i had to
resew them by myself at home i felt like wearing them in the morning
so i sewed them myself the sewing was alright
i can sew
well i told you i just felt lazy they were in that state for i don &apos;t know how long i have purchased those strings so i did and those things
and i left there for days i thought about taking it every day
so one day i thought i &apos;d do it i called for lobna in the morning and i fixed it
yes but when you wash them out they &apos;ll detach you &apos;ll have to iron them
do you want to get those large pants huh
yes for how much please
in any case i can &apos;t afford to
i can &apos;t handle myself now even more
i got you
that &apos;s alright
no i didn &apos;t tell you anything i can &apos;t decide i said i &apos;d go have fun i &apos;ll at least go take a look around
i even told sabrin to get me those plastic cans those things you know
anyway each month when i feel like i can barely make it i think to myself hopefully she won &apos;t tell me to bring her the money i bought from her the last time and i paid her
anyway each month i &apos;d be thinking if they &apos;d have some sales she &apos;d reach out and tell me it &apos;s alright i just bought you what you need each month i &apos;d be praying for them not to be delivered
i sometimes think that &apos;s it i &apos;m done then i would go to my aunt &apos;s and see the plastic i start getting tempted
yes anyway i told her yosr is tempting me so much she &apos;s showing me and my mouth starts watering
i actually totally kept it down lately i don &apos;t buy clothes or stuff or anything anymore
