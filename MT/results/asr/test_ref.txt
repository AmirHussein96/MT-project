me too% pw i mean just me and my neighbor that's not considered too many dishes
a real fire i didn't realize it the coincidence i was talking earlier i saw like this
and one kilogram of potatoes now costs three thousand that means those who can afford to cook chakchouka are considered rich

i am not interested in girls just like that i still haven't found someone who's worthy you know
she's getting bored she can't find things to do she was busy with her final year project report and now she's done
i will gloat if the ettarajji fans don't come i will gloat over that
i choose that one that costs nine hundred millimes i mean it doesn't work at all you know it only lasts one week
what's the deal with these shoes in the first place by god so you didn't tell her to get you another pair
we will go to the hospital he told him i am in front of the post office come here i need you he came
because he's put it a lineup which inspires no confidence and may god protect us
adsl is the best choice that's it but it doesn't work in our neighborhood they didn't get it yet
uh no sometimes sometimes but not always not always only when he has nothing else to do
there's something there's steg there actually and there are things apart from the port there are other things

plus it's so swollen so that swelling and that pus have to go away and ah
i am fine yesterday was saturday and you know that saturday is full of events as goshi says
anyway you know today uh i called you today to get you involved in my project the concrete project
ah it's as if you were present the association is going bananas and a situation
she said 'i won't come i'm already in ben daha near zahrouni'
ah i recognize it yeah yeah that one that's called aziz or hamdi or what's it called
but the problem will repeat itself because the association still has brokers inside it who
this one works you help him you work with a little so he will give you what you want
yes yes it anyway they just have% pw starting from ah there are still ten days of ramadan
because one can can hold six hundred grams it's half a kilogram and one hundred grams

i have a craving for that bordeaux and those tampon sleeves
we'll do it hasn't got in vain in vain like in the coming in
and if i can add something he's a young coach and he can still give and teach
it's possible it's possible we go to the stadium on wednesday forgive me allah on sunday
you get days in total two days for mohamed's wedding on the seventh and eighth
and they scored three to one anyway and they scored the goal at the eighty fifth minute
but it is not peeled i got upset because they didn't peel it
the other one was talking and so on i can't accept hypocrites
to make the shapes use a bowl a bowl then you put the mix of
because i got six and then i ran into trouble with sabri because of one of them
no girl i can't let it dry by itself i mean why all this rush
ah i'm not focused that is with with what exactly i found smoke traffic jam
so% pw i'd rather go to watch in a place you know that's got you understand and i'd be at ease
it is a bad thing my son it is a bad thing it is not normal that because of some pizza he behaves badly with his friend

she didn't even wear them she didn't wear them at all i mean she bought them in london and she brought them to tunis
i sometimes think that's it i'm done then i would go to my aunt's and see the plastic i start getting tempted
it's inside and see how it comes out it doesn't go out like the other straight up it comes out leaning
no this is hard work but what i ah how is it i rinse it wash it and let it drain alone
