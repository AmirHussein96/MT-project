i will gloat if the ettarajji fans don't come i will gloat over that
i choose that one that costs nine hundred millimes i mean it doesn't work at all you know it only lasts one week
what's the deal with these shoes in the first place by god so you didn't tell her to get you another pair
we will go to the hospital he told him i am in front of the post office come here i need you he came
because he's put it a lineup which inspires no confidence and may god protect us
adsl is the best choice that's it but it doesn't work in our neighborhood they didn't get it yet

she said 'i won't come i'm already in ben daha near zahrouni'
ah i recognize it yeah yeah that one that's called aziz or hamdi or what's it called
but the problem will repeat itself because the association still has brokers inside it who
this one works you help him you work with a little so he will give you what you want

because one can can hold six hundred grams it's half a kilogram and one hundred grams

and they scored three to one anyway and they scored the goal at the eighty fifth minute
but it is not peeled i got upset because they didn't peel it
the other one was talking and so on i can't accept hypocrites
to make the shapes use a bowl a bowl then you put the mix of
because i got six and then i ran into trouble with sabri because of one of them
no girl i can't let it dry by itself i mean why all this rush

because el-tarajji is tough and ivaktev is flying very high above us you understand me
you would need it yes the phone is not practical if you want to watch stuff on big screens you know
but i think that those were ordered and a lot of things from what i've showed you today that butter thing is left
it's that she wants him to benefit from his retirement he's done enough coaching you understand me
like from one project to another and from one subject to another subject it's making me crazy i don't understand anything at all
yes then it's a serious fire because now when you enter ah steg and gas and one it's frightening
for real it's an amount that takes two people to get it washed why would i wash it by myself
i don't care about the grades anyway in the end in the end you can throw out the diploma
but he has given up on% pw in three times he wants to revive the memories

he's so awful he's so awful i mean i ordered the hookah for five dinars and i didn't get any charcoal how could it be
i mean that's not acceptable you do work with jihen we knew he was in a relationship with her i mean you see

his father is in sousse he called him at four-thirty and he told him that he is leaving sousse he called him at six-thirty he told him that he is leaving sousse

'no 'she said' in the first semester i% pw let you do what you wanted but now there is no more playing'
it is life it is life this is the end of someone who doesn't think about his future
when they add another season it will be stupid like nsibti laaziza
yes and you just need to make sure what color she wants because there is white and red
they were going to talk but watad came as if he wanted to fix the issue
maybe not maybe you have like i said five so you add four and a half more days
no not a car wash two repair shops that sell car accessories

but even if you take them take them to the tailor to steam them with his hot iron they'd get attached
she didn't even wear them she didn't wear them at all i mean she bought them in london and she brought them to tunis
i sometimes think that's it i'm done then i would go to my aunt's and see the plastic i start getting tempted
it's inside and see how it comes out it doesn't go out like the other straight up it comes out leaning
no this is hard work but what i ah how is it i rinse it wash it and let it drain alone
that's all no no go and talk more with hadya and it'll be fine normally she'll let you speak more with her hadya
