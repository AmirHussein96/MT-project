and it cost a lot of money a lot of money two hundred and eighty thousand dinars three hundred and fifty you understand what do you want in it it's actually because it increases it increases with each horsepower because it works with horsepower
imagine that after they told me that it was done and everything was fine in manouba then my friend went to charguia and he told her your friend in manouba still hasn't come back to pick up her form tell her to bring it
i see you are right without energy with the solar energy and in the winter time for example you wouldn't have solar energy i would give extra bonuses to the employees so that they would bike more
i will talk to them about it tomorrow morning about what they will order and what they won't order and if they need some things that you already have at home i will take them to show them until they'll be able to see the rest

he loses anyway dude he started working at the marble factory and they lost a lot of money and marble went extinct in tunisia he then started working at a fireworks factory and fireworks went extinct
anyway each month i'd be thinking if they'd have some sales she'd reach out and tell me it's alright i just bought you what you need each month i'd be praying for them not to be delivered
at all i don't even dare to think about it until ah a place is empty on the stairs see that space where people walk in the middle of the stairs it's full of people
they're mocking people yeah they're mocking i swear will you change the lesson or what but he changed minor things for me you don't need to change a lot do you think they're going to notice
good for him good for him god god bless him and do you still meet ahmed i heard that he will go to germany or canada he has waiting for two years

i have nothing to do i'm just sitting here and the boss went out to do something so i had to stay outside and the air conditioner is running inside my hearts aches because of it shoot
'i don't have anything to do with this i'm free anyway make your plan before i go to manel 'and you we have to make a plan for you one day after the aid

mine is added to her bill and imen also has another bill already and if i have to pay the forty-five in just one month then no that would be too much for me because
good morning good morning good morning i hope you have a nice morning like the morning in which you ate all the delicious food at the breakfast like dates and ham i mean did you understand
let's say a tranche for fifty-five for this month and a tranche for fifty-five for next month because i'll add it to imen's bill

after they went i turned to sabri and i told him actually i will tell you something but do not get upset there is something wrong and they are planning something
did you understand me in brief i kept planning to go on until i couldn't anymore that's it the pain was too much i could feel it in my throat
i mean a festival a festival i mean you're able to watch it the opening and that order and that cleanness and whatnot on a sunday night at night
imagine if my father had caused a problem and that man was obviously rich which means though he was at fault he could be considered to be a victim it would switch
i mean i was just supposing but i think that she knows how could she not know that that one is for large amounts i mean if she ordered it then she totally needs it do you understand
the poor guy he always calls me it's me who is neglectful i don't call anybody already oh well it's only when my dad has a bonus and that's it it's going to be over
i don't get in the first place and you won't find that thermos anywhere i thought it would be once and for all i mean
do you understand it will go bad really fast so that one will keep the cheese and the butter from going bad do you understand
actually actually balbouli's real name is aymen mathlouthi but they call him balbouli because balbouli
you see ali plays chkobba and rummy in at the coffee shop in in london you see they would call a soccer player ali
the cars and whenever something makes him mad like dude one time the car refused to start from the start he left it in% pw uh in
that's it that's it something that you can't imagine we still have one or two minutes in this call i mean we finish them did you understand
and i think the other one is clio or ford god knows it's either blue or red or white or gray or black i don't know
it's good two dinars is good because we have a peach forum in two thousand and eighteen and we need a big quantity of peach
and that's not not the story that's not the story the thing is both of them knew they were both going out with rami with him at the same time
it doesn't bother me i have a lot of farms% pw uh% pw uh and a lot of boxes full of tomato cans i have a tomato can factory you know
and he behaves badly he got in the car he got out and he acted as if he was going to the hospital to visit his father my brother he is lying he wants
because normally they would peel it like a kiwi i can't take it you know if i put my hand on it and peel it that's not appropriate at a party
dude this one ford flex looks like not that it looks like it's a big four-wheel drive but squared on the top like the top of a piece of wood
a little longer it looks good with my high heels that one i thought it was short and i didn't like the collar it's closed and you know me i won't be comfortable
yeah the matte blue is really amazing otherwise ford series four there's that one jaguar they've released new cars xe you understand e e
i'll spend the holiday at my mother-in-law's if it's on sunday i'll be at my mother-in-law's if it's monday i'll be in tunis

where they sell where they sell where they sell you can actually take transport and it'll drop you in this one it'll drop you in it between the city and el kassaa
what was his name that one elmsakni's brother iheb yes iheb elmsakni iheb elmsakni and they have khalil bangoura
she would be frisking the bag and not a single drop would spill because there would be a lot of these things they were selling i don't know what i mean it would fall down and get spilled
and in which nour is the server your uncle abdel aziz is the cashier this one in preparing hooka and the other one is preparing preparing

ah he actually told him if you win if they'd call and make an offer of a hundred and fifty thousand dinars shave it off apparently they offered him more than fifty thousand dinars
yes because i don't think that she i mean i don't think that she will put food in it to store it it's obvious that she needs it for a large quantity
yes washing the lunch dishes every day is an annoying thing if it happens like once in a while and you do the dishes by yourself that would be ok but doing it every day is annoying
he turned to sabri and told him if my mom is at home we will not go if my mom is not at home we will go anyway his way of talking was tricky
it means i didn't see an accident in front of me i didn't didn't see anything on the street on the street there was nothing there was so much smoke correct black
you can't imagine how i was i was crying now when i go past that place the kids start to imitate me saying 'don't do anything dad'
you see we are not able to date one girl and he is dating two girls and they know each other they know each other focus on they know each other
dear they don't treat people the same way they give grades and things unfairly you see last year intissar and those guys who studied with them in the past all of them got seventeen and eighteen
it doesn't seem practical to me but it looks like it looks like a backpack i bought those sneakers at the time as well during the sale they were for ninty-nine and went down to thirty-five
